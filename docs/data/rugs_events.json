    "description": "<p>Are you looking to improve your data communication skills? Come just us for a book club. It will be headed up by Neal Fultz. The idea is to motivate us to read books and discussing them together. This will help all of us to develop our skills.<\/p> <p>The format will be that the leader will prepare a short summary of the material and present it to the group. We will then discuss the material and do some exercises.<\/p> <p>The expectations are that you will attend regularly. If you cannot make a commitment to attend, please wait until the next book club starts. It is also expected that participants will take turns being the leader. The leader should prepare a summary of the material that was read and present it to the group.<\/p> <p>We will meet each week, Wednesday between 3:30 and 5:00 PM PST for eight weeks.<\/p> <p>Book: Title: Communicating with Data: The Art of Writing for Data Science<br/>Dead Tree: <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/communicating-with-data-9780198862758\" class=\"linkified\">https://global.oup.com/academic/product/communicating-with-data-9780198862758<\/a><\/p> <p>Signing up: When you sign-up you will be placed on the waiting list.

    "description": "<p>Are you looking to land a data science job and want to practice take-home challenges? Did you spend hours and hours on take-home challenges which supposed to be finished in under 3 hours but have no feedback? Come join us for a coding camp. It will be headed up by Xi Chen. The idea is to motivate us to code and sharpen our skills. This will help all of us so you never have to worry about the technical interview again.<\/p> <p>The format will be that the organizer will hand out two take-home challenges one week in advance. You can choose either one or both to complete by yourself. Feel free to use Python or R. We will then discuss them together during the session.<\/p> <p>The expectations are that you will actually make effort to do the take-home problems each week. If you cannot make a commitment, please wait until the next club starts. It is expected that participants will complete the challenges or do the best they can within 3 hours. Experience suggests that this is a lower limit and it can be much more time.<\/p> <p>We will meet each week, Wednesday between 6:30 and 8:00 PM PST for six weeks. The first dataset will go out on July 7th.<\/p> <p>Signing up: When you sign-up you will be placed on the waiting list. We always have a lot of interest but the club is a significant commitment.

The model consists of two parts:<br/>A model for the election outcome (i.e. the vote share for each party based on poll data) and a model to assign a probability to the coalition of the actual government using expert survey data. An in-depth description and motivation is discussed in this talk. The model is fitted with (R)Stan, a Bayesian modeling framework, that can seamlessly be integrated into R.<\/p> <p># Agenda<br/>18:30 Intro<br/>18:35 Talk<br/>19:05 Q&amp;A<br/>19:30 Closing remarks (we can extend it if needed)<\/p> <p># Bios<br/>Marcus Gro√ü and Michelle Golchert are Data Scientists at INWT Statistics.<br/>Marcus holds a Ph.D. in Statistics and has several years experience consulting on and managing projects in the data science field.

UI plays a huge role in the success of Shiny projects. shiny.fluent enables you to build Shiny apps in a novel way using Microsoft‚Äôs Fluent UI as the UI foundation. It gives your app a beautiful, professional look and a rich set of components while retaining the speed of development that Shiny is famous for.<\/p> <p>Fluent UI is based on the Javascript library React, so it‚Äôs a challenging task to make it work with Shiny. We have put the parts responsible for making this possible in a separate package called shiny.react, which enables you to port other React-based components and UI libraries so that they work in Shiny.<\/p> <p>During the talk we will demonstrate how to use shiny.fluent to build your own Shiny apps, and explain how we solved the main challenges in integrating React and Shiny<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Kamil is a Full Stack Engineer at Appsilon. He graduated with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Warsaw. He is passionate about working across various technologies, leading projects, and developing internal tooling. Privately, he enjoys listening to<br/>jazz and has an interest in psychology and philosophy.<\/p> ",

Whenever friends found out about my synesthesia, they would want to know what color their names were in my head, and it got to be challenging to explain. When I found myself manually coloring squares in a spreadsheet to demonstrate what I saw in my mind's eye, I decided to build an app instead. The app lets you either set your own colors or see what mine look like. Then you can enter text, and it will display as a series of rectangles according to the colors you've selected. I also added a feature that mimics a Google form to collect survey responses from other people with synesthesia, so they can submit their color data if they want to.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>My name is Kaija (rhymes with Maya), and I'm an incoming PhD student in the ecology/evolutionary biology department at UCLA, where I'll be studying movement ecology and behavior of vultures using social network analysis. I've been using R for about six years, and for the past year I've been working as a data manager for an ecosystem science nonprofit. I'm on the board of SORTEE, an organization focused on openness and reproducibility in ecology and evolutionary biology. I didn't come from a computer science background, so I'm passionate about talking to people about incorporating R into their work in accessible and friendly ways.<\/p> <p>When I'm not at my computer, you can usually find me outdoors (hiking or birdwatching) or spending entire days in the kitchen making up recipes. I tweet and blog, mostly about R.<\/p> <p>*Introduction to Monte Carlo simulation, using Shiny<br/>Monte Carlo Simulation is a powerful methodology to model and understand the impact of uncertainty upon real life. In this talk, I will introduce Monte Carlo simulation through a simple example: I'm meeting my neighbor after work for dinner in our neighborhood. Given the uncertain length of our commutes, will we make it in time for our reservation? I'll talk through the scenario, then walk through a simple Shiny app that explores the power of Monte Carlo Simulation to recommend decisions under uncertainty.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>I am Ralph Asher, and I am the founder of Data Driven Supply Chain LLC, a Minnesota-based consultancy that helps organizations apply data science and AI methods, including simulation, to design and improve their supply chain. Prior to founding Data Driven Supply Chain, I worked as an Operations Research Scientist at Target, designing e-commerce supply chain networks, and at General Mills, designing warehousing networks. I have used R for supply chain analytics for over eight years at these companies. I live in the Minneapolis, MN area and love running in the (usually cool) Minnesota air.

    "description": "<p>Repeat speaker Sean Taylor returns in July to talk about causal inference.<\/p> <p>Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Conversations during the meetup are encouraged in the monthly-meetup-chat channel in the nyhackr slack: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.org/slack.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://nyhackr.org/slack.html<\/a><\/p> <p>The same week as this meetup, July 14-16, we also have what has become the annual Bayes and Stan workshop, taught by Jonah Gabry, Scott Spencer and Rob Trangucci, with Andrew Gelman popping in. More information is at <a href=\"https://www.tickettailor.com/events/landeranalytics/505284\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tickettailor.com/events/landeranalytics/505284<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Then September 9-10 the R Conference returns in-person (and virtual) with workshops on September 1! Find out more at <a href=\"https://rstats.ai/nyr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstats.ai/nyr/<\/a>.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Causal inference provides a useful toolkit for data scientists working in a wide variety of fields, but they may rightly wonder why it's needed and when it's most useful. In this talk, I tour a variety of data science applications and apply a causal inference lens to them. Framing problems using causal language yields interesting insights into the nature of the work we do as scientists, and helps sharpen the goals, requirements, and risks of our projects. We show that beyond the more standard applications like A/B testing, some data science tasks can (perhaps surprisingly) be described as estimating causal quantities, and how this changes our models and their predictions.<\/p> <p>About Sean:<br/>Sean J. Taylor is a staff data scientist at Lyft's Rideshare Labs team, where he works on causal inference, experimentation, forecasting, and structural modeling. Previously, he led the applied statistics team in Facebook‚Äôs Core Data Science team. He earned his PhD in Information Systems from NYU‚Äôs Stern School of Business as well as a BS in Economics from Wharton School. He specializes in using machine learning, statistics, and randomized experiments for measurement, forecasting, and policy decisions. Sean‚Äôs research spans a wide range of topics: online social influence, social networks, applied statistics, causal inference, and Bayesian modeling. He is also an avid engineer who enjoys putting research into practice by building software, such as his forecasting library Prophet.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EDT and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

The model consists of two parts:<br/>A model for the election outcome (i.e. the vote share for each party based on poll data) and a model to assign a probability to the coalition of the actual government using expert survey data. An in-depth description and motivation is discussed in this talk. The model is fitted with (R)Stan, a Bayesian modeling framework, that can seamlessly be integrated into R.<\/p> <p># Agenda<br/>19:30 Intro<br/>19:35 Talk<br/>20:05 Q&amp;A<br/>20:30 Closing remarks (we can extend it if needed)<\/p> <p># Bios<br/>Marcus Gro√ü and Michelle Golchert are Data Scientists at INWT Statistics.<br/>Marcus holds a Ph.D. in Statistics and has several years experience consulting on and managing projects in the data science field.

    "start": "2021-07-22",
    "description": "<p>Abstract:<br/>In 2020, there was suddenly worldwide interest in graphics on a level we don't normally see - people were checking news sites daily looking for graphs, maps, and any information about how the COVID pandemic was progressing over time. Along with this, there were some very novel forms of graphics, some of which worked and many of which did not. As the pandemic continued, however, most news organizations seemed to settle on certain categories of graphics for displaying COVID case counts, hospitalizations, and deaths. Watching the pandemic and the graphics explosion that resulted, I found relatively little research into how people perceive exponential growth, and even less research into the effectiveness of log scales for conveying information. I'll talk about a series of experiments that are currently under development to explore these two topics, as well as the evolution of graphics over the course of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>Bio: Susan Vanderplas is an assistant professor in the Statistics Department at University of Nebraska, Lincoln, researching the perception of statistical charts and graphs. She also works with the Center for Statistical Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE) at Iowa State University, developing statistical methods for examination of bullets, cartridges, and footwear.<\/p> <p>In her spare time (hah) she likes to sew, cross-stitch mildly off-color sayings, and bake things (usually badly).<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Why R? Webinar: \"Julia for R-Lovers: Ideas for a Dual Language Workflow\"<br/>with Kyla McConnell (PhD Student, University of Freiburg)<\/p> <p>Julia for R-Lovers: Ideas for a dual-language workflow<\/p> <p>Abstract<br/>As a language for statistical processing, R excels in its wide variety of highly developed packages and its unrivaled visualization abilities (as well as its open and accepting community!) However,<br/>the new kid on the block, the Julia language, has become a tempting rival; Julia promises to be easy-to-read and quick-to-adopt, but simultaneously impressively fast and powerful. Luckily, you don‚Äôt have to choose, because Julia and R are the perfect match, allowing you to use Julia for its power without abandoning the R features and packages you know and love.<\/p> <p>In this demo, I‚Äôll show you an example of a dual-language workflow that includes the best of both worlds. In addition to the basics of the Julia environment, I‚Äôll walk you through an example of using Julia together with the best parts of R. Specifically, I‚Äôll show how to go from exploring a dataset in familiar R syntax to fitting complex models in Julia that would be very slow or fail to fit in R, to visualizing your results in R without leaving your Julia environment!<\/p> <p>This basic introduction is meant to address beginners who are firmly rooted in R. We will not cover installing Julia on your computer or get you completely ready to go in Julia. Rather, the demo is intended to spark ideas for a R - Julia workflow and get you excited to discover more about Julia!<\/p> <p>Bio<br/>Kyla McConnell is a Ph.D. student in quantitative psycholinguistics at the University of Freiburg in Freiburg, Germany. In her work modeling individual differences in reading times of predictable phrases, she has recently adopted an R - Julia - R workflow for fitting statistical and machine learning models. An outspoken tidyverse and ggplot2 fan, she is co-organizer of R-Ladies Freiburg (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/rladies-freiburg/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/rladies-freiburg/<\/a>) as well as a local R-stats group for linguists. For her introduction to Julia for statistical modeling, she‚Äôs especially grateful to the instructors of the Potsdam Summer School on Statistical Methods for Linguistics and Psychology (<a href=\"https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2021/\" class=\"linkified\">https://vasishth.github.io/smlp2021/<\/a>).<\/p> ",

Die Ursachen daf√ºr k√∂nnen vielf√§ltig sein, wie fehlerhafte Kodierung, Ziffernsturz, Probleme bei der Erfassung, nicht verf√ºgbar etc. Im Extremfall muss man das entsprechende Merkmal von der Analyse ausschlie√üen oder der Datensatz kann f√ºr die Analyse nicht genutzt werden ‚Äì beides ist jedoch unerw√ºnscht. Wie also damit umgehen? Gibt es bessere Techniken, um das Problem zu l√∂sen? Wie gro√ü ist der Aufwand, diese Techniken in der Praxis umzusetzen? Kann man den Vorgang automatisieren?

As a result, statistical methods have been developed to address contamination sequences from reagents, unequal sampling, unbounded and undetected taxa, sparsity, and heterogeneity. I will talk about some of the statistical methods in molecular microbial data analysis and demonstrate the methods using a plant microbiome dataset and R/Bioconductor packages. This talk is based on A Statistical Perspective on the Challenges in Molecular Microbial Biology published in Jeganathan and Holmes (2021). The workÔ¨Çow is available at <a href=\"https://pratheepaj.github.io/diÔ¨ÄTop/\" class=\"linkified\">https://pratheepaj.github.io/diÔ¨ÄTop/<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Dr. Pratheepa Jeganathan is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McMaster University. Pratheepa's research focuses on addressing challenges in multi-domain data analysis. Her research team uses, extends, and develops statistical methods and computational tools to analyze microbiome multi-omic and spatial multi-omic data in R/Bioconductor, including topic analysis, hierarchical modeling, Bayesian statistics, multivariate statistics, bootstrap method, spatial statistics, and approximation theory in statistics. Currently, Pratheepa teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in statistics and data science.<\/p> <p>Before joining McMaster University, Pratheepa completed postdoctoral training in the Department of Statistics at Stanford University.<br/>She received a Ph.D. in Mathematics with an emphasis in Statistics and MS in Statistics from Texas Tech University. While completing her Ph.D., she interned at the Research and Testing Laboratory in Lubbock and the Clinical Research Institute at Texas Tech Health Sciences Center. She received a B.Sc.in Statistics and Operations Research from the University of Peradeniya in Sri Lanka.

Writing in their spare time, they produced The Epidemiologist R Handbook (epiRhandbook.com), a free new code reference book targeted to R users working in applied epidemiology and public health, but handy for anyone. The \"Epi R Handbook\" is full of code snippets and tutorials addressing day-to-day data cleaning, analysis, visualization, reporting, and collaboration challenges. The handbook also comes in an offline version for use in settings with low internet connectivity. Since its launch, the handbook has been used 200,000 times by 36,000 people in 203 countries/territories. In this session, founder Neale Batra is joined by co-authors Paula Blomquist and Aminata Ndiaye to discuss the handbook's utility for you, the intersection of R and public health, the project's next steps, and the editorial and technical challenges they faced creating this resource for the community.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Neale Batra is the founder and editor of the Epidemiologist R Handbook project. As an applied epidemiologist, he tries to leverage R to better inform decision-making in health emergencies. Currently he works for the COVID-19 analytics team at the World Health Organization (Geneva), but has previously worked internationally for Doctors without Borders and in the US for the public health departments of Philadelphia and Santa Clara County. He loves teaching, and in his spare time enjoys guiding rock climbing and backpacking trips.<\/p> <p>Paula Blomquist is an epidemiologist in Public Health England, where she works on the national surveillance of COVID-19. She spends much of her day job creating data visualisations and R markdown reports to monitor variants, with a particular fondness of {patchwork} and {flextable}. Paula has also used R for analyses in international deployments, most recently with the UK Emergency Medical Team to Samoa during the 2019 measles epidemic. Paula is a contributor to the Epidemiologist R Handbook, and excited to encourage more people in public health to learn to code.<\/p> <p>Aminata NDIAYE is a Biostatistician at Epicentre Research Department-MSF (Doctors without Borders). She graduated from Paris Descartes University School of Medicine in Public health and from Paris Saclay University School of Sciences in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. She previously worked at World Health Organization (WHO) as an analyst during the 10th Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and at Karolinska Institute‚Äôs department of medical epidemiology and biostatistics as a Research assistant. She is co-organizer and member of the R-ladies Stockholm group since its creation, in 2018.<br/>---<\/p> <p>R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Table-based information varies heavily in appearance, fonts, borders, and layouts. This makes the data extraction task challenging even when the text is searchable ‚Äì but more so when the table is only available as an image.<\/p> <p>This webinar presents how Spark OCR automatically extract tabular data from images. This end-to-end solution includes computer vision models for table detection and table structure recognition, as well as OCR models for extracting text &amp; numbers from each cell. The implemented approach provides state-of-the-art accuracy for the ICDAR 2013 and TableBank benchmark datasets.<\/p> <p>REGISTER HERE: <a href=\"https://events.johnsnowlabs.com/accurate-table-extraction-from-documents-images-with-spark-ocr\" class=\"linkified\">https://events.johnsnowlabs.com/accurate-table-extraction-from-documents-images-with-spark-ocr<\/a><\/p> ",

You built another AI model that will never see the light of day because it won‚Äôt make it past the AI ‚Äúvalley of death‚Äù ‚Äì the crossover of model development to model deployment across your enterprise. The handoff between data science and engineering teams is fraught with friction, outstanding questions around governance and accountability, and who is responsible for different parts of the pipeline and process. Even worse? The patchwork approach when building an AI pipeline leaves many organizations open to risks because of a lack of a holistic approach to security and monitoring.<\/p> <p>Join us to learn about approaches and solutions for configuring a ModelOps pipeline that‚Äôs right for your organization. You‚Äôll discover why it‚Äôs never too early to plan for operationalization of models, regardless of whether your organization has 1, 10, 100, or 1,000 models in production.<\/p> <p>The discussion will also reveal the merits of an open container specification that allows you to easily package and deploy models in production from everywhere. Finally, new approaches for monitoring model drift and explainability will be revealed that will help manage expectations with business leaders all through a centralized AI software platform called Modzy¬Æ.<\/p> <p>Register: <a href=\"https://info.datascience.salon/crossing-the-ai-valley-of-death-deploying-monitoring-models-in-production\" class=\"linkified\">https://info.datascience.salon/crossing-the-ai-valley-of-death-deploying-monitoring-models-in-production<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Our August Meetup will be a remote gathering; the Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Infographics are everywhere, and when well-designed can be a fantastic way of sharing data highlights in an engaging and visually appealing way to non-technical audiences. Typically infographics are custom made by a graphic designer who has been provided the numbers that will be represented in the graphic, and therefore can be time-intensive to produce. Producing more than one infographic of the same design to display different values (for instance, for different geographical areas) has a linear increase in production time for each n+1 graphic once the basic design time has been accounted for. This talk will describe a novel method for producing infographics using R that allows for dynamically adjusting the graphical elements based on any number of data values and rapidly producing bespoke versions. A walkthrough of the process used to create 3,142 custom infographics (one for each county in the US) will be presented to illustrate the process.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Zadra, PhD is a Director of Data Science at the non-profit Sorenson Impact Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. He combines his skills in statistics, programming, and data visualization with expertise in data privacy and policy to empower governments, nonprofits, and philanthropists working in a wide array of issue areas. His areas of focus include criminal justice data (including work with the PEW Charitable Trusts, Utah Department of Corrections, Utah Indigent Defense Commission, and Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice), early- and higher-education data including a multi-year project supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as other issue areas like homelessness or poverty, and has worked on many smaller projects building evaluations and impact measurements for a variety of social-good non-profits around the country. He received his doctorate from the University of Virginia, where he studied cognitive science and neuroscience and designed and conducted rigorous RCTs - and also fell in love with R way back in 2006!<\/p> ",

To do this, it uses the R package {queryparser} to translate SQL queries into R expressions, then uses {dplyr} to evaluate these expressions. In this talk, I'll describe the reasons for creating {tidyquery} and {queryparser} and compare them to several other packages with related goals, including {sqldf} and {dbplyr}. I'll also discuss the broader theme of \"syntaxes for data manipulation\"‚Äîhow they differ across languages, packages, and frameworks and what other efforts are underway to loosen the tight coupling of these syntaxes to the compute engines they control.<\/p> <p>About Ian:<br/>Ian Cook is the director of developer relations at Ursa Computing, where he promotes and contributes to the Apache Arrow project.

    "group": "R-Ladies Philly",
    "start": "2021-09-22",
    "description": "<p>Across public health, medicine, and social and behavioral sciences, researchers aim to answer causal questions. However, inferences about causation are challenging and require several assumptions to draw unbiased causal effects from observational data. This workshop discusses the difference between association and causation and introduces various methods to infer causal effects with observational data. We will then study R packages that implement propensity score techniques to estimate an average treatment effect ‚Äì such as matching, subclassification, and inverse probability weighting. The workshop also provides several implementation options depending on the data type and the target causal effects of interest.<\/p> <p>About our speaker:<\/p> <p>Youjin Lee is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the Brown School of Public Health. Her research focuses on developing causal inference methods with complex data where standard assumptions are often violated. She published R packages for causal inference with social network data and multilevel settings. Originally from South Korea, Youjin received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics from Johns Hopkin University. Before joining Brown University, she did her postdoctoral training at the University of Pennsylvania.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Spend Friday night discussing The Code Breaker (<a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Code-Breaker/Walter-Isaacson/9781982115852\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Code-Breaker/Walter-Isaacson/9781982115852<\/a>).<\/p> <p>The bestselling author of Leonardo da Vinci and Steve Jobs returns with a gripping account of how Nobel Prize winner Jennifer Doudna and her colleagues launched a revolution that will allow us to cure diseases, fend off viruses, and have healthier babies.<\/p> <p>When Jennifer Doudna was in sixth grade, she came home one day to find that her dad had left a paperback titled The Double Helix on her bed. She put it aside, thinking it was one of those detective tales she loved. When she read it on a rainy Saturday, she discovered she was right, in a way. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn‚Äôt become scientists, she decided she would.<\/p> <p>Driven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book‚Äôs author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his co-discovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned ‚Äãa curiosity ‚Äãof nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions.<\/p> <p>The development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution. Children who study digital coding will be joined by those who study genetic code.<\/p> <p>Should we use our new evolution-hacking powers to make us less susceptible to viruses? What a wonderful boon that would be! And what about preventing depression? Hmmm‚Ä¶Should we allow parents, if they can afford it, to enhance the height or muscles or IQ of their kids?<\/p> <p>After helping to discover CRISPR, Doudna became a leader in wrestling with these moral issues and, with her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in 2020. Her story is a thrilling detective tale that involves the most profound wonders of nature, from the origins of life to the future of our species.<\/p> ",
