    "description": "<p>Are you looking to improve your data communication skills? Come just us for a book club. It will be headed up by Neal Fultz. The idea is to motivate us to read books and discussing them together. This will help all of us to develop our skills.<\/p> <p>The format will be that the leader will prepare a short summary of the material and present it to the group. We will then discuss the material and do some exercises.<\/p> <p>The expectations are that you will attend regularly. If you cannot make a commitment to attend, please wait until the next book club starts. It is also expected that participants will take turns being the leader. The leader should prepare a summary of the material that was read and present it to the group.<\/p> <p>We will meet each week, Wednesday between 3:30 and 5:00 PM PST for eight weeks.<\/p> <p>Book: Title: Communicating with Data: The Art of Writing for Data Science<br/>Dead Tree: <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/communicating-with-data-9780198862758\" class=\"linkified\">https://global.oup.com/academic/product/communicating-with-data-9780198862758<\/a><\/p> <p>Signing up: When you sign-up you will be placed on the waiting list. We always have a lot of interest but the book club is a significant commitment. The coordinator will confirm your commitment. Please make sure that you get meet-up emails.<\/p> ",

Sean mostly specializes in methods for solving causal inference and business decision problems, and particularly interested in building tools for practitioners working on real-world problems. He is a generalist, who likes to hang out with people from many fields and borrow as many ideas as possible. He has collaborated with computer scientists, economists, political scientists, statisticians, machine learning researchers, and business school scholars. It’s fun for Sean to jump around a bit, continue learning new things and make connections between fields. Background: Ph.D. student at NYU’s Stern School of Business, ex-research scientist and manager on Facebook’s Core Data Science Team and currently head of the Rideshare Labs team at Lyft. <a href=\"https://seanjtaylor.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://seanjtaylor.com/<\/a><\/p> <p>### ABOUT TALK<br/>Improving two-sided marketplaces like Lyft's ridesharing business is accomplished when we implement better matching algorithms that create more efficient allocations. However, marketplaces generate complex causal graphs which make counterfactuals difficult to reason about and estimate. I describe the causal effects of matching we must estimate to allocate drivers to requests, and the potential confounding problems that bias estimates from more standard machine learning approaches. We will then discuss how causal inference ideas can be applied in related settings like search, ranking, and recommender systems.<\/p> <p>### ABOUT THE X-EUROPE DATA SCIENCE WEBINARS<br/>X-Europe Webinar Series is a joint online event of Vienna Data Science Group, Data Science Croatia, Frankfurt Data Science, Budapest Data Science Meetup, BCN Analytics, Budapest.AI, Barcelona Data Science and Machine Learning Meetup, Budapest Deep Learning Reading Seminar, Warsaw R Users Group, PyData Slovakia, and Data Scientists Ireland.<\/p> ",

UI plays a huge role in the success of Shiny projects. shiny.fluent enables you to build Shiny apps in a novel way using Microsoft’s Fluent UI as the UI foundation. It gives your app a beautiful, professional look and a rich set of components while retaining the speed of development that Shiny is famous for.<\/p> <p>Fluent UI is based on the Javascript library React, so it’s a challenging task to make it work with Shiny. We have put the parts responsible for making this possible in a separate package called shiny.react, which enables you to port other React-based components and UI libraries so that they work in Shiny.<\/p> <p>During the talk we will demonstrate how to use shiny.fluent to build your own Shiny apps, and explain how we solved the main challenges in integrating React and Shiny<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Kamil is a Full Stack Engineer at Appsilon. He graduated with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Warsaw. He is passionate about working across various technologies, leading projects, and developing internal tooling.

You built another AI model that will never see the light of day because it won’t make it past the AI “valley of death” – the crossover of model development to model deployment across your enterprise. The handoff between data science and engineering teams is fraught with friction, outstanding questions around governance and accountability, and who is responsible for different parts of the pipeline and process. Even worse? The patchwork approach when building an AI pipeline leaves many organizations open to risks because of a lack of a holistic approach to security and monitoring.<\/p> <p>Join us to learn about approaches and solutions for configuring a ModelOps pipeline that’s right for your organization. You’ll discover why it’s never too early to plan for operationalization of models, regardless of whether your organization has 1, 10, 100, or 1,000 models in production.<\/p> <p>The discussion will also reveal the merits of an open container specification that allows you to easily package and deploy models in production from everywhere. Finally, new approaches for monitoring model drift and explainability will be revealed that will help manage expectations with business leaders all through a centralized AI software platform called Modzy®.<\/p> <p>Register: <a href=\"https://info.datascience.salon/crossing-the-ai-valley-of-death-deploying-monitoring-models-in-production\" class=\"linkified\">https://info.datascience.salon/crossing-the-ai-valley-of-death-deploying-monitoring-models-in-production<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>This meetup we'll have two shorter talks by Jai Ranchod and Bryan Lewis. Details below.<\/p> <p>Talk 1: Jai Ranchod - Extract tabular data from PDFs with pdftools<\/p> <p>I'm going to be talking about how to pull tabular data out of a PDF based on partial string matching and some functions in the \"PDF Tools\" package. The need to do this presented itself when the president of the management company wanted a table of information for the 60+ properties in our portfolio and our software vendor said they could only give us PDFs of word docs.<\/p> <p>Jai (\"Jay\") Ranchod is currently an Operations and Financial Analyst are Rose Community Management, a property management firm based in NYC with offices in Independence, OH. I started using R at my previous job at Epic Systems which is an electronic healthcare record company as part of the quality control process on their cognitive computing products. Since then I have taken several online classes in R, data science, and machine learning including a professional certificate program in data science taught using R. I have a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Wooster and recently finished my MBA from John Carroll University.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Bryan Lewis - R and DuckDB<\/p> <p>DuckDB (<a href=\"https://duckdb.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://duckdb.org<\/a>) is a new embedded SQL database library in the spirit of other embedded databases like SQLite. Unlike SQLite, DuckDB uses a column-oriented data layout (like R data frames) and has a particular focus on performance for interactive data analysis. DuckDB's integration with R is so complete that it can work directly on in-memory language objects without copying. This lets you use DuckDB directly on R data frames, including excellent support for dplyr.<\/p> <p>I'll show some practical examples of R and DuckDB and share my thoughts how to best use these technologies together.<\/p> <p>Bryan Lewis is a mathematician, author of the irlba and threejs R packages, and coauthor of the recent CRC textbook \"A Computational Approach to Statistical Learning.\" He previously worked on Mike Stonebraker's open-source SciDB array database project.<\/p> <p>Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.<\/p> ",

This talk will introduce spatial data broadly, and cover some of the basic workflows and troubleshooting steps in R. Specifically, we will work with vector data, focus on the `sp` and `sf` libraries, and produce an interactive map in R. Example data and code will be provided.<\/p> <p>We will be meeting over Zoom (Meeting link visible when you RSVP). Join us to connect with other R users in the Boulder area and learn some new techniques to apply in your work!<\/p> <p>We hope you'll also join our local Slack workspace to keep the R help and conversation flowing!

    "description": "<p>*What are we going to learn:<br/>Docker is a platform for creating “containers” on your system. You can think of them like a mini system on your computer. They are completely self-contained, isolated environments on your system. These containers include their own operating system, application software, scripts, data, etc. Containers are useful for a lot of things, but here I’ll focus on a quick introduction to using Docker for reproducibility in R. I will demonstrate on how to set-up Docker, run R on a Docker container and few other use cases.<\/p> <p>*Who is going to present:<br/>Malindrie is a PhD candidate at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland. She works on developing bioinformatics methods for the analysis of large-scale single-cell data using advanced statistical modelling and uses modern statistics tools to understand human disease. Malindrie completed her Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Statistics in 2016.<\/p> <p>* When are we meeting?<br/>The talk will start at 5:00 pm for approximately 45 mins and 15 min Q&amp;A.

    "description": "<p>Text is one of the most prominent and extensive data sources in the digital world. It can be an insight into consumer opinions, social media trends, and literary story arches. However, it can be difficult to analyze without specialized tools and commands. The tidytext package and framework makes it easy to go from full text files to clean data and ultimately, analysis!<\/p> <p>The workshop will start with the building blocks of text analysis: separating a text into smaller chunks, removing punctuation, and identifying frequent words or phrases. If you’ve joined our previous text analysis meetups before, this will be a great recap; if you haven’t, this will bring you right up to speed! We’ll show you all you need to know so beginners to the topic are very much welcome.<\/p> <p>The focus for the evening will be on going beyond individual words in isolation to n-grams: units of a set number of words (e.g. bigrams like “I think”, “think that”, “that tidytext”, “tidytext is”, “is great”.). This will allow us to get a sense of context about words based on the company they keep and address typical text analysis problems (e.g. \"happy\" preceded by \"not\" being given a positive sentiment score).<\/p> <p>We’ll top it all off with some truly unique visualizations that show the relationship between words, like bigram network plots with ggraph. Materials will be based on the book Tidy Text Mining by Julia Silge and David Robinson (chapter 4).<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>En esta sesión comenzaremos a explorar cómo de potentes son los métodos de clusterización para solucionar múltiples problemas y lo haremos a través de varios ejemplos.<\/p> <p>Lo aprenderemos de la mano de Elena Rivas Ruzafa (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-rivas-ruzafa/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-rivas-ruzafa/<\/a>) , Head of Engineering - Digital Products que durante la sesión nos guiará y aprenderemos mediante ejemplos.<\/p> <p>Dentro del machine learning, la clusterización se enmarca dentro del aprendizaje no supervisado, es decir, esos algoritmos para los que solo disponemos de un conjunto de datos de entrada que no están etiquetados y sobre los que obtendremos información sin conocer de antemano cuál será la respuesta correcta. Esta situación se da muy a menudo y provocará que la forma en la que hemos de testear los resultados sea muy particular. También veremos que la creación de visualizaciones de datos y la generación de gráficos, se convertirá en una parte esencial de la exploración de dichos resultados.<\/p> <p>Lo que obtendremos tras el proceso de clusterizacióon será una segmentación de los datos en grupos similares que serán lo que conocemos como “clústeres”. Aunque es un problema de clasificación no debemos confundir clusterización con clasificación. Ambos son métodos de identificación de patrones, pero mientras el primero pertenece al aprendizaje no supervisado, el segundo, más conocido, pertenece al aprendizaje supervisado. También trataremos de explicar estas diferencias.<\/p> <p>Además de resolver algunos casos prácticos durante la sesión, veremos cómo estos métodos pueden solucionar diferentes problemas en múltiples ámbitos (en medicina para el diagnóstico de enfermedades, en redes sociales para encontrar grupos de comportamiento similares, en finanzas para generar estrategias dirigidas a los diferentes grupos de clientes...)<\/p> <p>Todo esto lo haremos en el entorno de programación R en el que existen múltiples paquetes que implementan algoritmos de clustering y funciones para visualizar sus resultados. Durante la sesión trabajaremos con algunos de los más interesantes.<\/p> <p>Estas son las librerías que usaremos, para que vayáis instalándolas. Las dos últimas son las específicas de clustering:<\/p> <p>library(tidyverse)<br/>library(gridExtra)<br/>library(dplyr)<br/>library(reshape2)<br/>library(ggmap)<br/>library(factoextra) # clustering algorithms &amp; visualization<br/>library(cluster) # clustering algorithms<\/p> <p>Aquí están los materiales! <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_madrid/blob/master/README.md#[masked]---taller-online\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_madrid/blob/master/README.md#[masked]---taller-online<\/a><\/p> ",

Isn’t the statement that R is ‘just a research-only language mainly used by academia’ outdated?<\/p> <p>Spoiler alert: you definitely can use R in production. From ETL to (Shiny) web applications to machine learning models: some of the main business processes at Analytic Health are powered by R. During this talk, Veerle will dive into what “production” means and how you can use R in a context outside of academia. By showing how R is being used at Analytic Health and how processes and applications are deployed and managed we hope to show you that R can do more than statistics only. This talk will inspire you to take R one step further, and by providing pointers to which tools you can use to build robust processes you’ll leave this talk ready to use R in production yourself!<\/p> <p>ABOUT VEERLE<br/>---------------------<\/p> <p>Veerle is an entrepreneur and Data Scientist who gets excited about data and programming. She is Managing Director and Head of Data Science at Analytic Health, a UK-based company that develops intelligent and accessible technology which gives organisations the tools they need to accelerate innovation in healthcare. She is a R developer with a Master’s Degree in Data Science and multiple years of experience in the pharmaceutical market. Besides programming in R (and Shiny) she also develops multiple web applications for healthcare organisations using Vue.js and Node.<\/p> ",

He has previously developed statistical software both in academic and national security contexts.<\/p> <p>## TALK 2<\/p> <p>Deploy R to production with AWS Batch and Apache Airflow<\/p> <p>About Markus Nutz:<\/p> <p>Markus is currently working as a Data Scientist at OBI next, where he has spent the last two years building a customer data platform and putting analytical/data products into production. He is excited by all kind of data work. Markus holds a Bachelor in Political Science and a Master in Applied Data Science and Measurement.<\/p> <p>## TALK 3<\/p> <p>Intelligente Behandlung von Fehlwerten - gewusst wie!<\/p> <p>Nahezu alle Rohdaten beinhalten Fehlwerte. Die Ursachen dafür können vielfältig sein, wie fehlerhafte Kodierung, Ziffernsturz, Probleme bei der Erfassung, nicht verfügbar etc. Im Extremfall muss man das entsprechende Merkmal von der Analyse ausschließen oder der Datensatz kann für die Analyse nicht genutzt werden – beides ist jedoch unerwünscht. Wie also damit umgehen? Gibt es bessere Techniken, um das Problem zu lösen? Wie groß ist der Aufwand, diese Techniken in der Praxis umzusetzen? Kann man den Vorgang automatisieren? Auf alle diese Fragen versucht der Vortrag eine Antwort zu geben.<\/p> <p>Über Helmut Grillenberger:<\/p> <p>Helmut hat Statistik studiert und verfügt über eine langjährige Erfahrung im analytischen Bereich. Dazu zählt z. B. der Aufbau einer Analyseabteilung für Yves Rocher, die Umsetzung von DWH Konzepten und die Entwicklung von analytischen Anwendungen bei Peter Hahn, die Anonymisierung von Kundendaten für die Münchener Rück mit R, die Entwicklung von R-Konzepten bei Siemens Financial Services, u.v.m.<\/p> <p>Zu seinen Themen zählen u. a. Statistik, maschinelles Lernen und neuronale Netze. Seine bevorzugte Programmiersprache ist R.<\/p> <p>Er arbeitet als Analytiker und bietet für R einen Proof Of Concept an, indem ein R-Paket zu Lösung von Kundenproblemen erstellt wird.

In this talk, I’ll explain how sequential, diverging and qualitative color schemes are each suited to a different type of data. We’ll then look at a variety of plots that could be improved with alternative color choices. My hope is that these examples will serve as conversation starters for a lively discussion on matching color to data.<\/p> <p>Bio: Joyce Robbins (@jtrnyc) is a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University.

The idea is to motivate us to code and sharpen our skills. This will help all of us so you never have to worry about the technical interview again.<\/p> <p>The format will be that the organizer will hand out two take-home challenges one week in advance. You can choose either one or both to complete by yourself. Feel free to use Python or R. We will then discuss them together during the session.<\/p> <p>The expectations are that you will actually make effort to do the take-home problems each week. If you cannot make a commitment, please wait until the next club starts. It is expected that participants will complete the challenges or do the best they can within 3 hours. Experience suggests that this is a lower limit and it can be much more time.<\/p> <p>We will meet each week, Wednesday between 6:30 and 8:00 PM PST for six weeks. The first dataset will go out on July 7th.<\/p> <p>Signing up: When you sign-up you will be placed on the waiting list. We always have a lot of interest but the club is a significant commitment.

The model consists of two parts:<br/>A model for the election outcome (i.e. the vote share for each party based on poll data) and a model to assign a probability to the coalition of the actual government using expert survey data. An in-depth description and motivation is discussed in this talk. The model is fitted with (R)Stan, a Bayesian modeling framework, that can seamlessly be integrated into R.<\/p> <p># Agenda<br/>18:30 Intro<br/>18:35 Talk<br/>19:05 Q&amp;A<br/>19:30 Closing remarks (we can extend it if needed)<\/p> <p># Bios<br/>Marcus Groß and Michelle Golchert are Data Scientists at INWT Statistics.<br/>Marcus holds a Ph.D. in Statistics and has several years experience consulting on and managing projects in the data science field.

Whenever friends found out about my synesthesia, they would want to know what color their names were in my head, and it got to be challenging to explain. When I found myself manually coloring squares in a spreadsheet to demonstrate what I saw in my mind's eye, I decided to build an app instead. The app lets you either set your own colors or see what mine look like. Then you can enter text, and it will display as a series of rectangles according to the colors you've selected. I also added a feature that mimics a Google form to collect survey responses from other people with synesthesia, so they can submit their color data if they want to.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>My name is Kaija (rhymes with Maya), and I'm an incoming PhD student in the ecology/evolutionary biology department at UCLA, where I'll be studying movement ecology and behavior of vultures using social network analysis. I've been using R for about six years, and for the past year I've been working as a data manager for an ecosystem science nonprofit. I'm on the board of SORTEE, an organization focused on openness and reproducibility in ecology and evolutionary biology. I didn't come from a computer science background, so I'm passionate about talking to people about incorporating R into their work in accessible and friendly ways.<\/p> <p>When I'm not at my computer, you can usually find me outdoors (hiking or birdwatching) or spending entire days in the kitchen making up recipes. I tweet and blog, mostly about R.<\/p> <p>*Introduction to Monte Carlo simulation, using Shiny<br/>Monte Carlo Simulation is a powerful methodology to model and understand the impact of uncertainty upon real life. In this talk, I will introduce Monte Carlo simulation through a simple example: I'm meeting my neighbor after work for dinner in our neighborhood. Given the uncertain length of our commutes, will we make it in time for our reservation? I'll talk through the scenario, then walk through a simple Shiny app that explores the power of Monte Carlo Simulation to recommend decisions under uncertainty.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>I am Ralph Asher, and I am the founder of Data Driven Supply Chain LLC, a Minnesota-based consultancy that helps organizations apply data science and AI methods, including simulation, to design and improve their supply chain. Prior to founding Data Driven Supply Chain, I worked as an Operations Research Scientist at Target, designing e-commerce supply chain networks, and at General Mills, designing warehousing networks. I have used R for supply chain analytics for over eight years at these companies. I live in the Minneapolis, MN area and love running in the (usually cool) Minnesota air.

You built another AI model that will never see the light of day because it won’t make it past the AI “valley of death” – the crossover of model development to model deployment across your enterprise. The handoff between data science and engineering teams is fraught with friction, outstanding questions around governance and accountability, and who is responsible for different parts of the pipeline and process. Even worse? The patchwork approach when building an AI pipeline leaves many organizations open to risks because of a lack of a holistic approach to security and monitoring.<\/p> <p>Join us to learn about approaches and solutions for configuring a ModelOps pipeline that’s right for your organization. You’ll discover why it’s never too early to plan for operationalization of models, regardless of whether your organization has 1, 10, 100, or 1,000 models in production.<\/p> <p>The discussion will also reveal the merits of an open container specification that allows you to easily package and deploy models in production from everywhere.

    "description": "<p>Our August Meetup will be a remote gathering; the Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Infographics are everywhere, and when well-designed can be a fantastic way of sharing data highlights in an engaging and visually appealing way to non-technical audiences. Typically infographics are custom made by a graphic designer who has been provided the numbers that will be represented in the graphic, and therefore can be time-intensive to produce. Producing more than one infographic of the same design to display different values (for instance, for different geographical areas) has a linear increase in production time for each n+1 graphic once the basic design time has been accounted for. This talk will describe a novel method for producing infographics using R that allows for dynamically adjusting the graphical elements based on any number of data values and rapidly producing bespoke versions. A walkthrough of the process used to create 3,142 custom infographics (one for each county in the US) will be presented to illustrate the process.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Zadra, PhD is a Director of Data Science at the non-profit Sorenson Impact Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. He combines his skills in statistics, programming, and data visualization with expertise in data privacy and policy to empower governments, nonprofits, and philanthropists working in a wide array of issue areas. His areas of focus include criminal justice data (including work with the PEW Charitable Trusts, Utah Department of Corrections, Utah Indigent Defense Commission, and Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice), early- and higher-education data including a multi-year project supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as other issue areas like homelessness or poverty, and has worked on many smaller projects building evaluations and impact measurements for a variety of social-good non-profits around the country. He received his doctorate from the University of Virginia, where he studied cognitive science and neuroscience and designed and conducted rigorous RCTs - and also fell in love with R way back in 2006!<\/p> ",

Find out more at <a href=\"https://rstats.ai/nyr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstats.ai/nyr/<\/a>.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Causal inference provides a useful toolkit for data scientists working in a wide variety of fields, but they may rightly wonder why it's needed and when it's most useful. In this talk, I tour a variety of data science applications and apply a causal inference lens to them. Framing problems using causal language yields interesting insights into the nature of the work we do as scientists, and helps sharpen the goals, requirements, and risks of our projects. We show that beyond the more standard applications like A/B testing, some data science tasks can (perhaps surprisingly) be described as estimating causal quantities, and how this changes our models and their predictions.<\/p> <p>About Sean:<br/>Sean J. Taylor is a staff data scientist at Lyft's Rideshare Labs team, where he works on causal inference, experimentation, forecasting, and structural modeling. Previously, he led the applied statistics team in Facebook’s Core Data Science team. He earned his PhD in Information Systems from NYU’s Stern School of Business as well as a BS in Economics from Wharton School. He specializes in using machine learning, statistics, and randomized experiments for measurement, forecasting, and policy decisions. Sean’s research spans a wide range of topics: online social influence, social networks, applied statistics, causal inference, and Bayesian modeling. He is also an avid engineer who enjoys putting research into practice by building software, such as his forecasting library Prophet.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EDT and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>The periscope R package is a framework that you can use to significantly speed up your shiny development – whether you are just writing your first collaborative application or taking on a bigger project that will be deployed to many users. Periscope can significantly \"up\" your Shiny game by jump-starting development in a way that is flexible and robust. This lets you focus on the content of your application, as opposed to the mechanics (and those insidious pitfalls!) of building a shiny application for multiple users.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Dr. Connie Brett is the CEO, Founder, and Principal Data Scientist of Aggregate Genius Inc. located in BC, Canada. She is experienced in using many types of models and algorithms as well as architecting cutting-edge big-data analytics-integrated platforms. She has submitted publications and patents; contributes to and maintains R packages and frameworks (such as periscope) in the open-source community; and attends and speaks at industry events. With over 20 years spent focusing on producing solid analytical models, software and visualization tools – as well as custom IT solutions architecture – she continues to carry forward her passion for helping clients realize true business insights from analytics.<\/p> <p>Workshop details:<br/>Date and time: July 21, 2021 at 6:00pm<br/>Webinar link: RSVP to view link<br/>Note: Meeting password is embedded in the link after the ?<br/>If you have trouble getting into the meeting, please message Jasmine<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>Yuka, Jasmine, Lisa, and Sayemin<\/p> <p>**********************IMPORTANT************************<\/p> <p>1.

    "start": "2021-07-22",
    "description": "<p>Abstract:<br/>In 2020, there was suddenly worldwide interest in graphics on a level we don't normally see - people were checking news sites daily looking for graphs, maps, and any information about how the COVID pandemic was progressing over time. Along with this, there were some very novel forms of graphics, some of which worked and many of which did not. As the pandemic continued, however, most news organizations seemed to settle on certain categories of graphics for displaying COVID case counts, hospitalizations, and deaths. Watching the pandemic and the graphics explosion that resulted, I found relatively little research into how people perceive exponential growth, and even less research into the effectiveness of log scales for conveying information. I'll talk about a series of experiments that are currently under development to explore these two topics, as well as the evolution of graphics over the course of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>Bio: Susan Vanderplas is an assistant professor in the Statistics Department at University of Nebraska, Lincoln, researching the perception of statistical charts and graphs. She also works with the Center for Statistical Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE) at Iowa State University, developing statistical methods for examination of bullets, cartridges, and footwear.<\/p> <p>In her spare time (hah) she likes to sew, cross-stitch mildly off-color sayings, and bake things (usually badly).<\/p> ",

She put it aside, thinking it was one of those detective tales she loved. When she read it on a rainy Saturday, she discovered she was right, in a way. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn’t become scientists, she decided she would.<\/p> <p>Driven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book’s author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his co-discovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned ​a curiosity ​of nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions.<\/p> <p>The development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution. Children who study digital coding will be joined by those who study genetic code.<\/p> <p>Should we use our new evolution-hacking powers to make us less susceptible to viruses? What a wonderful boon that would be! And what about preventing depression? Hmmm…Should we allow parents, if they can afford it, to enhance the height or muscles or IQ of their kids?<\/p> <p>After helping to discover CRISPR, Doudna became a leader in wrestling with these moral issues and, with her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in 2020. Her story is a thrilling detective tale that involves the most profound wonders of nature, from the origins of life to the future of our species.<\/p> ",

Writing in their spare time, they produced The Epidemiologist R Handbook (epiRhandbook.com), a free new code reference book targeted to R users working in applied epidemiology and public health, but handy for anyone. The \"Epi R Handbook\" is full of code snippets and tutorials addressing day-to-day data cleaning, analysis, visualization, reporting, and collaboration challenges. The handbook also comes in an offline version for use in settings with low internet connectivity. Since its launch, the handbook has been used 200,000 times by 36,000 people in 203 countries/territories. In this session, founder Neale Batra is joined by co-authors Paula Blomquist and Aminata Ndiaye to discuss the handbook's utility for you, the intersection of R and public health, the project's next steps, and the editorial and technical challenges they faced creating this resource for the community.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Neale Batra is the founder and editor of the Epidemiologist R Handbook project. As an applied epidemiologist, he tries to leverage R to better inform decision-making in health emergencies. Currently he works for the COVID-19 analytics team at the World Health Organization (Geneva), but has previously worked internationally for Doctors without Borders and in the US for the public health departments of Philadelphia and Santa Clara County. He loves teaching, and in his spare time enjoys guiding rock climbing and backpacking trips.<\/p> <p>Paula Blomquist is an epidemiologist in Public Health England, where she works on the national surveillance of COVID-19. She spends much of her day job creating data visualisations and R markdown reports to monitor variants, with a particular fondness of {patchwork} and {flextable}. Paula has also used R for analyses in international deployments, most recently with the UK Emergency Medical Team to Samoa during the 2019 measles epidemic. Paula is a contributor to the Epidemiologist R Handbook, and excited to encourage more people in public health to learn to code.<\/p> <p>Aminata NDIAYE is a Biostatistician at Epicentre Research Department-MSF (Doctors without Borders). She graduated from Paris Descartes University School of Medicine in Public health and from Paris Saclay University School of Sciences in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. She previously worked at World Health Organization (WHO) as an analyst during the 10th Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and at Karolinska Institute’s department of medical epidemiology and biostatistics as a Research assistant.

But with that flexibility, comes a<br/>high learning curve. In this workshop, I will be teaching 3 basic<br/>concepts to create any chart with D3. These concepts are SVGs, data<br/>binding, and scales. When you understand these fundamentals you will<br/>be able to use your d3 scripts with your R shiny apps through the r2d3<br/>R package.<\/p> <p>I’m excited to teach you about the foundations of working with D3.js.<\/p> ",
