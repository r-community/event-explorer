We'll talk about three tools which both make it easier to handle bigger data locally and scale nicely to cloud architecture when required:<\/p> <p>1. Parquet. We all want more data, but nobody really wants a 281 Gb CSV. Parquet is a well-supported alternative that solves a lot of the problems with CSVs.<br/>2. Arrow Datasets. (Experimental!) What do you do when you've got more data than memory? Arrow Datasets are a really easy-to-use option to pull out what you need.<br/>3. Apache Drill. When you need a power tool, Drill lets you treat a hard drive like a database, putting the power of SQL at your fingertips without the setup.<\/p> <p>And thanks to our open-source community, they all work beautifully from R!

    "description": "<p>Join our next meetup, virtually!<\/p> <p>Jorge Cimentada | tidyflow: a simplified and fresh workflow for doing machine learning with tidymodels<\/p> <p>Machine Learning programming is hard. Managing your data, splitting, resampling, preprocessing, modeling, and grid search into different objects can prove to be difficult. One can predict on the testing data by mistake, forget whether the preprocessing has been applied to the data or not, or simply do not remember the name of all the tuning parameters to specify in the grid. The `tidyflow` package builds upon `tidymodels` to bundle all of these steps into a coherent flow. It gives the same flexibility as the separate `tidymodels` package but makes machine learning modeling much more linear. In this talk we’ll introduce the benefits of tidyflow and walk through some examples of how to use it.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>18:00 Intro<br/>18:05 Jorge's talk<br/>18:35 Q&amp;A<br/>19:00 Closing remarks<\/p> <p>----<br/>Bio: Jorge Cimentada<\/p> <p>PhD in Sociology from Pompeu Fabra University and currently a Research Scientist at the Laboratory of Digital and Computational Demography at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research.

He has worked on data science projects both in the private sector and in academic research and is interested in merging cutting edge machine learning techniques with classical social statistics.

In this talk, we will explore a few examples of successful, effective, ongoing partnerships between data scientists and community stakeholders to promote social justice. The discussion will include an overview of the tools/technologies (including R!) that were useful in those initiatives. We will also learn how we could lend our technical skills the fight for social justice by either aligning with existing initiatives or kickstarting new projects.<\/p> <p># Bio:<\/p> <p>Dr. Sydeaka Watson is a native of New Orleans, Louisiana and currently lives in Dallas, Texas. Sydeaka earned a Ph.D. in Statistics from Baylor University and has several years of teaching experience. As a Research Assistant Professor in The University of Chicago Biostatistics Laboratory, she consulted with over 110 biomedical research teams in The University of Chicago Medical Center, specializing in statistical analysis and experimental design for clinical research studies. In both of her Senior Data Scientist roles in the AT&amp;T Chief Data Office and at Elicit Insights, she used predictive analytics and visual tools to implement custom solutions for customer behavior analytics and customer management. Now, as Founder and Owner of Korelasi Data Insights, LLC, Sydeaka develops custom deep learning solutions to enable extraction of insights from complex data sources, particularly in the areas of computer vision (image recognition) and text analytics.<\/p> <p>Dr. Watson is passionate about issues related to social justice advocacy and diversity &amp; inclusion in STEM careers. In previous years, Dr. Watson served as Chair of the American Statistical Association (ASA) Committee on Minorities in Statistics and was Co-Organizer of the Dallas Blacks in Technology Meetup. Currently, Sydeaka serves as Organizer of the Dallas Chapter of R-Ladies Global.

Actuaries, who are experts in risk analysis for insurers, use this information to improve the insurance rate-making process. Personalized driving risk indicators can also promote driving safety.<br/>The starting point is data collected from inertial measurement units installed in vehicles, combined with the corresponding records of accidents. We will address the most relevant current challenges in driving risk measurement.<br/>Illustrations with several real data sets provided by insurance companies will answer questions:<br/>How should pay-per-mile insurance schemes be designed?<br/>How can near-miss telematics be used to identify risky drivers?<br/>What is the power of risk analytics, percentile charts, and reference curves to monitor drivers?<br/>We will emphasize the enormous potential of this field to design better insurance products and improve safety. We will perhaps be able to guess why Tesla is urgently looking for actuaries in the last few weeks.<\/p> <p>SPEAKER<br/>Montserrat Guillen has a Ph.D. in Economics, MSc in Mathematical Statistics, and MA in Data Analysis.

Just to give you a sneak peek of the potential application of seq2seq model can be speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, Neural Machine Translation (NMT), and image caption generation.<\/p> <p>This workshop will showcase on how to build a language model that we’ll focus on using recurrent neural network which captures the entire context of the input sequence.

However, the tools for creating well-formatted tables in R have been either limited in scope or cumbersome to use. The {gtsummary} package was written to work with the {gt} package from RStudio to create presentation-quality tables using sensible defaults but with high customizability, helping reduce the need for post-hoc table formatting. This talk will introduce users to the {gtsummary} package, from the basic functions for summary tables to details of customization options.<\/p> <p>Emily is a biostatistician at Cleveland Clinic in the Department of Quantitative Health Sciences and The Taussig Cancer Institute where she collaborates with oncologists on applied clinical research and does methodologic research on statistical methods for clinical trial design and survival analysis.

    "description": "<p>By: Sam Kloese<\/p> <p>Insurance companies do their best to charge premiums that are proportional to the risk of the insured. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are a common method of helping determine the relative level of risk for different classes of business. GLMs have the advantages of being easily explainable and programmable, come with several statistical tests to justify their significance, and have a lot of precedence for their use in insurance.<\/p> <p>This session we will give some background on GLMs and then dive right into building GLMs with R. I will demonstrate how GLMs are an obvious improvement over univariate methods using a theoretical example. Then I will give a walkthrough of GLM modeling decisions on a real dataset. This presentation will rely on the following packages: tidyverse, ggplot2, and insuranceData. The real dataset case will be based on the dataOhlsson table from the insuranceData package.<\/p> ",

Participating groups include RLadies, PyLadies, Women in Machine Learning/Data Science, SFU Scientific Programming, and Women Techmakers. As of March 2020, the Datajam has transitioned to a fully virtual event! The event kicks off on September 11, 2020, with exciting workshops on R, Python, and virtual collaboration in GitHub. The main hackathon portion of the event will occur from 9am-5pm on September 12, 2020. That evening, we'll be featuring a Q&amp;A panel composed of both industry professionals and academics. This year our theme is \"hack for a plastic waste free future.\" Datajam participants will work to bring awareness to the plastics crisis with projects that aim to understand, visualize, and make predictions about plastic waste data.<\/p> <p>Curious about how our virtual hackathon will operate?<\/p> <p>Datajam Goes Virtual<br/>Our event committee is working hard to set this event up for success in the virtual space. Here’s a few areas on which we are focusing:<br/>Virtual networking: we’ll be setting up opportunities for participants to meet one another in small group settings and will encourage teams to connect virtually.<br/>Tutorials: Tutorials will continue as planned, but in a virtual setting. We’ll still have volunteers available to help participants troubleshoot issues that come up.<br/>Collaboration: Use of version control and meeting software will be essential for teams to connect and collaborate. We’ll be sharing more details and guidelines for virtual collaboration soon.<\/p> <p>We hope you are able to attend! If you have any questions please email us at:<br/>[masked]<\/p> ",

I completed my B.S. in statistics at UC Riverside in 2017, and while there I was a part of our student chapter of the ASA and participated in undergraduate research. I grew up in the San Gabriel Valley and Riverside, CA and am a first-generation college graduate.\"<br/>Gabriel Ruiz's Abstract:<br/>\"I will talk about the important role mentors have played in my short career so far. Using personal anecdotes from my undergraduate years, I hope to show that a mentor can be an older classmate or colleague in an organization (like R-Ladies Irvine!), a boss you find through a research or internship program, or a wise professional by the name of Madeline Bauer you reached out to an event like the ASA DataFest competition. My key message: it always helps to have someone in your corner cheering you on, especially at key junctures like deciding what classes to take, what internships to apply to, or what to do after graduation.\"<br/>Fatima Tuz-Zahra's Bio:<br/>\"My name is Fatima Tuz-Zahra, I graduated from SDSU with an MS in Statistics. I am currently working as a statistician at UC San Diego. My interests are statistics, causal inference and machine learning.\"<br/>Fatima Tuz-Zahra's Abstract:<br/>\"This talk will focus on how, in your role as a student and/or a job seeker, you can find a mentor to charter your route to success as smoothly as possible.\"<\/p> <p># Live-streaming &amp; Meeting Materials<br/>- All registered attendees will receive a Zoom link to join the meeting.

Specifically, how the physical and skilled outputs of team-sport athletes can be analysed, using the tidyverse and data mining techniques, to gain insights into matches and training.<\/p> <p>Alice is a research scientist within the Institute for Health and Sport at Victoria University. She is also embedded as a sports scientist at the Western Bulldogs, a professional Australian Rules football club who play in the AFL, as part of a strategic partnership between Victoria University and the Western Bulldogs.<\/p> <p>Alice co-supervises a number of PhD students who are working on sports analytics projects. These projects include profiling team-sport athlete physical and skilled output using time-series analysis, detecting kicks via wearable sensors, and understanding tactical behaviours using spatiotemporal data.<\/p> <p>Alice is particularly passionate about programming in R and visualising sports analytics data. She has taught workshops on programming in R for sport scientists, and loves helping people learn how to clean, analyse and visualise their sports data. Aside from sports analytics research and programming in R, Alice loves spending time outdoors with her mini dachshund puppy (Dudley), baking sweet treats, following Suncorp Super Netball, and watching equestrian events (mainly eventing &amp; showjumping) on TV.<\/p> <p>We hope you will all be able to join us for this exciting seminar!

The term ‘Web Scraping’ refers to the automated gathering of information from websites hosted on the internet. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis. Andrew has recently used web scraping to create the Trundler API and R package: a repository of historical pricing data of goods sold by major local retailers (<a href=\"https://www.trundler.dev/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.trundler.dev/<\/a>). The possibilities presented by this technology are endless, and we are super excited for this opportunity to learn more!<\/p> <p>Outline<\/p> <p>Session 1 (7 October):<br/>• Introduction to Web Scraping<br/>• Scraping with Screenshots<br/>• Working with URLs<\/p> <p>Session 2 (14 October): Locating content with CSS and XPath<br/>Session 3 (21 October): Scraping static sites with {rvest}<br/>Session 4 (28 October): Scraping dynamic sites with Selenium<\/p> <p>These sessions will take place via Google Meet at 17:30 sharp and last a maximum of 90 mins.

En este taller se enseñará a importar y manejar este tipo de datos a R. Además, se demostrará la lectura y escritura de archivos .xls y .xlsx (paquetes readxl y writexl), el manejo de archivos con múltiples pestañas (paquete purrr), celdas con formato (paquetes tidyxl y unheadr), y la nueva funcionalidad del paquete googlesheets4 que permite leer y escribir en hojas de cálculo en línea, facilitando la colaboración de manera reproducible. Al final del taller, los asistentes serán capaces de compatibilizar el uso de R con las hojas de cálculo en sus flujos de trabajo y colaboraciones.<\/p> <p>Para este taller es necesario tener instalado R igual o superior a 3.6 y los paquetes dplyr, readxl, purrr, writexl, tidyxl, googlesheets4, y unheadr (versiones de CRAN).<\/p> <p>Dr. Luis D.

In this talk, we'll take a look over the key R packages that helped me index the repos, and rapidly build a dashboard to track our progress.<\/p> <p>We'll cover:<\/p> <p>* googledrive<br/>* pins<br/>* git2r<br/>* furrr &amp; future<br/>* plumber APIs<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Designing meaningful assessments when teaching R<\/p> <p>### Melanie Stefan (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MelanieIStefan\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/MelanieIStefan<\/a>)<\/p> <p>A growing number of institutions teach their students how to use R. For instructors, the question arises of how to design meaningful assessments. Meaningful assessments should capture the course learning objectives, and should also bear some resemblance to a \"real\" task the student may have to do later in their professional life. They may also need to capture additional skills, such as the ability to work in teams. In the past year, I have taught R within an \"Applied Data Science\" course for undergraduate students in the Edinburgh-Zhejiang joint degree programme in Bioinformatics in China. In this talk, I will share my experiences with assessments in this course, including what went well and what very much did not go well.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you there!!<\/p> <p>/f<\/p> ",

At its core, racism is a powerful system that creates false hierarchies of human value; its warped logic extends beyond race, from the way we regard people of different ethnicities or skin colors to the way we treat people of different sexes, gender identities, and body types. Racism intersects with class and culture and geography and even changes the way we see and value ourselves. In How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi takes readers through a widening circle of antiracist ideas--from the most basic concepts to visionary possibilities--that will help readers see all forms of racism clearly, understand their poisonous consequences, and work to oppose them in our systems and in ourselves. Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science with his own personal story of awakening to antiracism. This is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond the awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a just and equitable society. Praise for How to Be an Antiracist \"Ibram X. Kendi's new book, How to Be an Antiracist, couldn't come at a better time. . . . Kendi has gifted us with a book that is not only an essential instruction manual but also a memoir of the author's own path from anti-black racism to anti-white racism and, finally, to antiracism. . . . How to Be an Antiracist gives us a clear and compelling way to approach, as Kendi puts it in his introduction, 'the basic struggle we're all in, the struggle to be fully human and to see that others are fully human.' \"--NPR \"Kendi dissects why in a society where so few people consider themselves to be racist the divisions and inequalities of racism remain so prevalent. How to Be an Antiracist punctures the myths of a post-racial America, examining what racism really is--and what we should do about it.\"--Time<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

Our brief stints as a AAAS Policy Fellow introduced us to many of the ways in which scientists contribute to government and policy, gave us an in-depth look at the processes of a small part of a massive federal agency, and led to collaborations and friendships with some amazing scientists pursuing careers in government and policy. In this informal talk, we will share our experiences with the application process and in the fellowship, an overview of what we learned and gained from the program, and what limited advice we can offer to anyone interested in the fellowship.<\/p> <p>Wynn Meyer is an assistant professor of Biological Sciences at Lehigh University, where she is starting a lab to research genomic changes associated with dietary variation in mammals, and teaches Personal Genomics and Biostatistics. Her somewhat meandering career path has included jobs with a Red Cross genetic testing lab, an anti-hunger non-profit, research with species ranging from yeast to flies to lemurs to manatees, and most recently a AAAS policy fellowship at the NIH Office of Data Science Strategy. In this role she developed the NIH DATA Scholars Program, co-chaired a panel on artificial intelligence (AI) and healthcare for the AAAS Human Impacts of AI symposium, and facilitated connections between NIH and the National Science Foundation (NSF) in data science. Wynn loves R and its wide range of applications but is still learning how to use the tidyverse.<\/p> <p>Sam Tyner is a data scientist at Tritura, a technology services company that specializes in legal services. Sam earned her PhD in Statistics from Iowa State University in 2017. After a brief postdoc stint, Sam served as the first AAAS STPF fellow at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, where she worked in the Office of Survey Methods Research. In her role as a fellow, she worked on machine learning and data visualization projects, including Natural Language Processing problems and developing shiny apps for internal BLS use. Her other interests include network analysis and effective communication of statistics.<\/p> <p>Dr. Amanda Price is an AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow and began her detail in the Child Development and Behavior Branch in the NICHD in August 2019, where she manages the Cognitive Development, Behavioral Neuroscience, and Psychobiology Program. Before that, she earned a Ph.D. in Human Genetics from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development in Baltimore, MD. Her work focused on measuring epigenomic and transcriptomic changes that occur during human brain development in cells isolated from postmortem brain tissue to better understand the relevant cell types and potential timing of action of genetic risk for schizophrenia, an adult-onset psychiatric disease thought to arise from perturbed developmental processes in early life.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hi, R-Ladies!<\/p> <p>In our last few events, we resolved to challenge ourselves to grow in our R programming skills. Congratulations to those of you who made it through the lectures and practice problems in the \"Data Analysis with R\" course on Udacity.<\/p> <p>Link to the course: <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-with-r--ud651<\/a><\/p> <p>To help us all get a firmer understanding of the concepts learned in the course, we have decided to work on a class project. In our last event, we voted to create a series of projects around the Loan Default Prosper dataset suggested in the Udacity course in Lesson 10 for the Final Project. Details are provided in this document. The Loan Default Prosper dataset is the second-to-last row in the table.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qEcwltBMlRYZT-l699-71TzInWfk4W9q5rTCSvDVMpc/pub\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qEcwltBMlRYZT-l699-71TzInWfk4W9q5rTCSvDVMpc/pub<\/a><\/p> <p>This type of dataset appears often in data science interview challenges, so it would be helpful to get familiar with the dataset, learn loan/credit terminology, and gain some initution about the unique challenges an analyst will encounter with this type of project. In this meetup, we will get an introduction to this dataset and get a first look at the first mini-project that we will work on together as a group.<\/p> <p>We will also have a chance to briefly discuss the social justice initiatives that Sydeaka Watson discussed in her Why R? webinar talk, \"Data Science for Social Justice Activism\". To attend/register for the Why R? webinar, see the details provided at the following link.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dallas/events/273060804/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/rladies-dallas/events/273060804/<\/a><\/p> <p>*************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community. Slack is a messaging platform where we will share open job opportunities, free or low-cost online training materials, and R-Ladies group projects that will help you practice your R programming skills and develop a portfolio that could be used to showcase your skills to hiring managers.<\/p> <p>Webinar + Slack sign-up: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJhvSg-YrNYOrmju1yrXvYhFM7xMey1WpDq1NSGIp6x41VaA/viewform\" class=\"linkified\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJhvSg-YrNYOrmju1yrXvYhFM7xMey1WpDq1NSGIp6x41VaA/viewform<\/a><\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>About R-Ladies Dallas<\/p> <p>R-Ladies Dallas welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking &amp; expert upskilling.

This presentation will provide a brief introduction to evolution, an overview of an optimisation problem and a walkthrough of how evolutionary algorithms work. We will explore how evolutionary algorithms can be applied to the travelling salesman problem, early diagnosis of Leukaemia (my PhD work), dinosaurs learning to walk, and a banking industry problem: optimisation of cash delivery to ATMs.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Dr. Manjula Dissanayake is a data scientist working at Tesco Bank. His current work includes building predictive models on customer behaviour and helping to develop the future analytics platform for Tesco Bank. His past work ranges from weather prediction &amp; renewable energy generation to software engineering in large scale distributed systems (Adobe). His research interests also includes feature selection and classification on cancer datasets and optimising chemotherapy treatment schedules.<\/p> ",

In regression analysis, the nature of the data dictates which model type is appropriate. Models differ depending on the distribution of the response variable. This workshop will introduce four types of models in which the distributions of the response variable are: (i) normal (continuous, with bell-shaped density function), (ii) gamma (continuous, with density having a long right tail), (iii) binary (discrete, assuming values 0 or 1), and (iv) Poisson (discrete, assuming values 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.). For each regression, a definition and all must-know facts will be discussed. Further, the expression for the fitted model will be explained and how to interpret estimated regression coefficients will be taught. You will be shown how to use the model for prediction. The course will give examples in R and you will be taught how it create these models and interpret the output. You will work in small groups to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material.<\/p> <p>We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be setup and loaded with the code and data that is needed.

Due to the pandemic, I’ve decided to record the training and put it on YouTube. At the moment I’ve put together videos for the first four sessions of my ‘Learning R course’ with the final two videos planned for later this year. In this talk I’ll give a quick overview of the entire six sessions, including the fourth session where I wrote a model in R that simulates the first innings of a Twenty20 cricket match. I’ll also give some tips and advice on the practical side of creating videos to post on YouTube, such as what kind of microphone to use, how to do screen capture, whether video editing software is needed and which ones are best and affordable, etc. The talk will be accessible and hopefully useful to people from all experience levels in R, from beginners to experts.<\/p> <p>Please RSVP and a link will be posted and emailed out the day of the talk.<\/p> ",

After a quick intro to machine learning and the GBM algorithm, I will show how easy it is to train and then use GBMs in real-life business applications using some the most popular open source implementations (xgboost, lightgbm and h2o). We’ll do all this in both R and Python with only a few lines of code and this talk will be accessible for a wide audience (with limited prior knowledge of machine learning). Finally, in the last part of the talk I will provide plenty of references that can get you to the next level. GBMs are a powerful technique to have in your machine learning toolbox, because despite all the latest hype about deep learning (neural nets) and “AI”, in fact GBMs usually outperform neural networks on structured/tabular data most often encountered in business applications.<\/p> <p>OUR SPEAKER<\/p> <p>Szilard Pafka, PhD<br/>Chief Scientist, Epoch (USA)<\/p> <p>Szilard studied Physics in the 90s and obtained a PhD by using statistical methods to analyze the risk of financial portfolios.

Creating your own R community can be rewarding, not to mention fun! In this talk, we will share our experiences of founding an R-stats group in our local university community as well as taking leadership roles in our R-Ladies chapter. Throughout, we will share our stories and tips of how to foster a group that is inclusive and accessible, create effective resources and share them on online platforms, teach (and even live code) with confidence, and create an atmosphere that is fun and supportive. At the end of this talk, we hope you will have a better idea of how to get involved in your local community and be inspired to start your own #rstats group!<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Kyla McConnell and Julia Müller are Ph.D. students at the University of Freiburg, where they conduct quantitative psycholinguistic research. It was in this context that they founded the 'Statistics study group for linguists’, a group of postgraduate students and ECRs who gather to learn fundamental and cutting-edge topics in statistics. Additionally, they are heavily involved with R-Ladies Freiburg and regularly host workshops for the group. They are both passionate about statistical education, particularly for women and underrepresented groups, and outspoken tidyverse fans.<\/p> ",

Did you know that R has a vast amount of tools available for executing traditional data engineering and workflow tasks? We don’t buy the narrative that Python is the only “production-quality” data science language and will showcase R’s ability to interface with the command line, manage files and directories, access environmental variables, talk to SQL databases, and more!<\/p> <p>Michael Thomas is the Chief Data Scientist at Ketchbrook Analytics, a software and analytics consulting firm out of Hartford, CT. He holds a B.S. in Accounting and Mathematics from Stonehill College, and an M.S. in Business Intelligence &amp; Analytics from Saint Joseph’s University. He has worked across a multitude of industries during his career, including public accounting, marketing, banking, financial services, agriculture, insurance, and information technology. He is passionate about combining data, analytics, and software to help everyday businesses make better decisions and operate more efficiently.<\/p> <p>Talk #2<br/>Presented by Leo PeBenito<\/p> <p>This lightning talk is a brief introduction to computational methods for addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic using R and the tidyverse. The classic SIR model will be applied to the Johns Hopkins University CSSE data set. Elements of the tidyverse will be explored through three vignettes: analysis using dplyr and purrr, visualization using tidyr and ggplot2, and when to return a tibble from a function.<\/p> <p>Leo PeBenito's background is in chemistry and biophysics, and his favorite molecule is melittin. He currently works as a data scientist on topics related to signal processing and ML. Two people that inspire him are Esther Duflo and Hadley Wickham.<\/p> <p>Talk #3<br/>Presented by Arafath Hossain<\/p> <p>This talk is about how we used R to productionalize a predictive model that helps business users interact with the model and use it as a powerful tool in their decision making. This application enables the business users to interact with the data, slice and dice the data and recalculate predictions based on their input changes. Here’s a high-level application architecture showing how the application works: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive\" class=\"linkified\">https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive<\/a><\/p> <p>Arafath Hossain is a data scientist at Illinois State University. Arafath received his bachelor in business administration from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, then worked in the market research and telecommunication industry before moving to the US and completing his MS in Technology. He works as a data scientist helping business partners improve student retention by identifying at-risk students early and prescribing possible interventions.<\/p> <p>Talk #4<br/>Presented by David Zimmermann<br/>A brief introduction to the rintrojs package.<\/p> <p>This talk shows how you can use the rintrojs package to create tours for shiny applications. A guided tour allows the developer of an app to show its users how the UI is designed to be used and to thoroughly explain certain aspects of an app increasing the user experience. The talk gives a brief introduction to the package and also shows how rintrojs can work with shinydashboards, tables, or leaflet maps.<\/p> <p>David is a senior data scientist at Cologne Intelligence, a consulting firm specialised in software and data solutions, based in Cologne. He holds a PhD in economics/computational finance from the University of Witten/Herdecke, an MSc in Finance and Investment from the University of Edinburgh, UK, and a BA in economics and international politics from Zeppelin University, but eventually ventured off into data science, machine learning, and more and more R programming. He is interested in everything R related, be it the tidyverse, shiny, tidymodels, or raw performance using Rcpp.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Prettier R Graphs and Documents with {showtext}+{prettydoc}<\/p> <p>Description:<\/p> <p>In this talk I will introduce two R packages that aim at making your plots and R Markdown documents prettier. First, the {showtext} package makes it easy to use your favorite fonts in R plots with virtually any graphics device. The function interface is device-independent, and fonts can either come from a local machine or from an online repository such as Google Fonts.<\/p> <p>In the second part, I will introduce the {prettydoc} package that provides a number of alternative themes for R Markdown documents. They are designed to be good-looking yet small in size. There are also some unique features of {prettydoc} such as code highlighting options and offline math expressions.<\/p> <p>At the end of the talk, I will mention how to extend the two packages to fit your own need, for example creating a font package, or adding a new theme for {prettydoc}.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Yixuan Qiu is an assistant professor in the School of Statistics and Management at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). His research interests include statistical computing, deep learning models, and data visualization. Yixuan is an active software developer in the R community, and has authored and maintained many popular packages including RSpectra, RcppNumerical, recosystem, showtext, and prettydoc. Before joining SUFE, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He obtained his PhD in statistics from Purdue University in 2018.<\/p> <p>Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Our October Meetup will be a remote gathering. The Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Visual representations of data inform how machine learning practitioners think, understand, and decide. Before charts are ever used for outward communication about a ML system, they are used by the system designers and operators themselves as a tool to make better modeling choices. Practitioners use visualization, from very familiar statistical graphics to creative and less standard plots, at the points of most important human decisions when other ways to validate those decisions can be difficult. Visualization approaches are used to understand both the data that serves as input for machine learning and the models that practitioners create. In this talk, learn about the process of building a ML model in the real world, how and when practitioners use visualization to make more effective choices, and considerations for ML visualization tooling.<\/p> <p>Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC where she works on open source modeling tools.

Hence, the idea that it can be a great tool for people who work offline, alone, with other kinds of files ends up flying under the radar for too many people. In this talk, I would like to showcase how Git can be a valuable tool for researchers in general, who often use R for data analysis instead of package development, as well as other tools for the production of presentation documents such as papers and slides.<\/p> <p># Get ready!<br/>The speaker strongly believes in learning by doing, so this will be a hands-on seminar.

As such, they're important because they have the potential to influence both the use and development of packages.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I'll argue that these counts are often inflated. This inflation occurs for two reasons. First, there are log entries that record downloads that are (often orders of magnitude) smaller than a package's source or binary file. Second, there are regular and repeated efforts to download all of the packages on CRAN. Together, the two create a systematic inflation that is negatively related to a package's popularity and positively related to its number of versions.<\/p> <p>I'll conclude by showing how I'm working to reduce the effect of this inflation on the R 'packageRank' package (CRAN and GitHub). For details about 'packageRank', see <a href=\"https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank#readme\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank#readme<\/a>.

Hiding signals in simulated data and then trying to recover that information using machine learning can be a useful way to learn the capabilities and limitations of various ML algorithms. It also presents a good opportunity to introduce some of the standard functions for sampling, generating random numbers from various distributions, matrix manipulations, and so forth to people new to R programming.<\/p> <p>We'll focus on generating data to test feature selection approaches, explore the effects of distractor variables, get a better understanding of what \"feature importance\" means, and do our best to devise \"diabolical\" datasets to confuse particular algorithms.<\/p> <p>###############<br/>Felix Schildorfer<br/>Accounting and Data Stewardship<\/p> <p>For most organizations (small and large) digital transformation is something that has already happened. While they are continuously updating technologies, the migration from physical to digital record keeping has already been completed. This has led to increased automation across the board. While the effect of technology on business operations is straightforward to understand and project, as well as being increasingly familiar to end users, it is also important to recognize the effect digitization has on information distribution. End users of organizational data are increasingly accustomed to the ability to access and update information on an almost continuous basis from a variety of sources. Financial information is not excluded from such an evolution. The tools for managing this are starting to appear within the marketplace, data exists both inside and outside of organizations, and accountants have the necessary skills to effect change. The only next step is for professionals to seize the opportunity and leverage their skills and competencies to fully realize and maximize this moment.<\/p> <p>In this talk I will explore data governance in relation to accounting, \"true value\" of accounting information and the role of accountants in this changing and challenging world of big data.<\/p> ",

Visit <a href=\"https://rstats.ai/gov/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstats.ai/gov/<\/a> to learn more and use code nyhackr for a 20% discount on tickets.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Although data cleaning is a frequent topic of conversation (and commiseration) in the world of data science, data validation---somewhat surprisingly---is discussed relatively less often. So in this talk, data validation will take centre stage, as we take a look at what it is (and is not), as well as some guiding principles, best practices and overall criteria to assess/ensure data validity. The talk will also cover several R packages aimed at this precise topic, for instance: {validate}, {assertr} and {ensurer}, as well as other related packages or functions, with examples provided as we go along. By the end of this talk, the aim is to have provided an overview on the principles and tools in this area, while highlighting the importance of the topic itself.<\/p> <p>About Caterina:<br/>Dr. Caterina Constantinescu is a data scientist working at Tesco Bank, whose past work ranges across areas such as research methods, national health data, occupational therapy, transport and data for good. Her academic background prior to this involved researching if various emotion-generating stimuli used in lab settings could approximate emotional states occurring in daily life. For several years she was also the organiser of the R meetup in Edinburgh (EdinbR), followed by organising the DataTech conference in 2019. Currently, her work focuses on writing Shiny apps that support data-driven decision-making across the bank.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 6 and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>We are excited to try a new event format: a dedicated time and supportive virtual space for us all to do some coding. We will use a Tidy Tuesday dataset to do data exploration, visualisation and analysis. Every participant will be free to take whatever direction they like and the coding will be done largely independently. But fear not, we will help each other when we get stuck and we will share our creations at the end of the event.<\/p> <p>This event is meant for R-Ladies with any level of coding skills: whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, you'll definitely get an opportunity to practice your skills and learn something new.<\/p> <p>To participate, you need a computer with an installation of R and internet access. The workshop will be happening on Zoom - all attendees will be sent the access password in advance of the event. You can install Zoom on your computer for free if you like, but you can also use it via your internet browser.<\/p> <p>Here is a very rough agenda:<br/>5:30pm Welcome and introductions<br/>5:45pm Get coding<br/>6:30pm Quick check-in<br/>7:15pm Sharing our findings and creations<br/>7:30pm Closing of the event<\/p> <p>To find out more about the Tidy Tuesday initiative, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday<\/a> or explore the #TidyTuesday hashtag on Twitter.<\/p> ",

    "group": "R-Ladies Edinburgh",
    "start": "2020-10-28",
    "description": "<p>Modeling and machine learning in R involve a bewildering array of heterogeneous packages, and establishing good statistical practice is challenging in any language. The tidymodels (tidymodels.org) collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, we’ll focus on three specific reasons to consider using tidymodels. We will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering.<\/p> <p>Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC where she works on open source modeling tools. She is an author, an international keynote speaker, and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice. Julia loves text analysis, making beautiful charts, and communicating about technical topics with diverse audiences.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>R-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community.<\/p> <p>A question we often get is \"Are men welcome to attend this event?\"<\/p> <p>As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladies’ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.<\/p> <p>**As such, we strongly encourage cis-men who attend this event come as guests of R-Ladies who are minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender).**<\/p> <p>All attendees are strongly encouraged to review the R-Ladies Code of Confuct (<a href=\"https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct<\/a>) and must abide by it.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hi everyone,<\/p> <p>The R Ladies chapters of the Netherlands are partnering up and are hosting an online book club. As a first book, we chose to read and discuss Hadley Wickham's Advanced R book (<a href=\"https://adv-r.hadley.nz/\" class=\"linkified\">https://adv-r.hadley.nz/<\/a>).<br/>Join us for our next meeting, in which Janine Khuc will present the key points of Chapter 17: “Big Picture\"- that introduces us to the key concepts of metaprogramming, a powerful idea that deeply influences much R code. At the most basic level the idea is explored 'that code is data that can be inspected and modified programmatically'. We'll discover why we can write things like library(purrr) instead of library(\"purrr\") within R and many more things.<\/p> <p>You can find the full schedule and more information here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladiesnl/book_club\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladiesnl/book_club<\/a><\/p> <p>Feel free to sign up to discuss one of the chapters there!<\/p> <p>ABOUT Janine<br/>----------------------<br/>Janine is a data scientist and one of the R-Ladies Amsterdam co-founders. Within the data science world she loves the intricacies that come with data science in the medical world, involving messy data (generation) and medical decision making that go beyond the technical nitty gritty. With her background in psychology she is well equipped to thoroughly understand the the requirements that go into a well designed data science project. She entered the world of data science through R- where her love for the language and the community developed. Now she is busy bringing the community in Amsterdam together supporting others in achieving their full programming potential through R.<\/p> <p>REQUIREMENTS<br/>----------------------<br/>Make sure to read the chapter (17) in advance!<\/p> <p>LINK TO MEETUP<br/>———————————<br/>See on the right<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct. Anyone who violates this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, Meetup membership or other condition. We are emphatically queer and trans-friendly. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn.

    "description": "<p>About the instructor: Join Dr. Maria C. Ramos, a Visiting Research Fellow at Duke Network Analysis Center (www.mariacramos.com), for her workshop on network analysis. Maria Ramos is a social scientist and networks scholar. She recently obtained a PhD in Sociology from Duke University and is now a Visiting Research Fellow at Duke Network Analysis Center. Maria’s research portfolio is diverse and interdisciplinary. Her current projects employ network science to understand HIV prevention, social-ecological systems, collaboration within organizations, and networks of beliefs and mental models. Maria regularly consults with organizations and research teams interested in leveraging network analysis to solve applied problems. She is also an avid R user and loves developing and teaching R workshops and tutorials.<\/p> <p>Workshop description: We live in an interconnected world: from the Web, transportation systems, and disease spread to our friendships and families, many aspects of our lives consist of interdependencies and connections among entities. Network analysis provides a framework and a set of tools for studying systems and patterns of relationships. This workshop will provide a gentle introduction to network analysis' concepts, methods, and applications. We will begin with an overview of the networks approach and its applications in various disciplines. Through hands-on activities, we will visualize networks and assess their general structure using different indices. We will also identify subgroups and key players. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to examine networks and characterize their properties using R.<\/p> <p>Details: We will post or send out zoom links and materials closer to the event date.<\/p> ",
