    "description": "<p>Вы этот раз мы соберемся онлайн вместе с нашими друзьями из Applied R Munich.<\/p> <p>С организацией трансляции нам в очередной раз помогает JetBrains. Спасибо им за это.<\/p> <p>Поговорим про использовании R в лингвистике, Fuzzy Matching и машинном обучении в R. Все доклады будут на английском.<\/p> <p>Анонсы докладов:<\/p> <p>Speaker 1:<br/>Anton Antonov, dxFeed Solutions GmbH,<br/>R in linguistic studies<br/>I have always known that linguistics and mathematics have a lot in common. Still, I was surprised to discover the true extent of that similarity. The complexity, the aesthetics, seemingly impossible problems that are resolved by establishing intrinsic relations between abstract objects... Finally, the helpfulness of R in dealing with these challenges.<br/>In this obviously non-serious talk, I will be speaking about my amateurish attempts at passing a particularly complex online course in linguistics using only my head, a pen, a sheet of paper, and R.<\/p> <p>Speaker 2:<br/>Alexey Osipov, Sidenis,<br/>Linking via Fuzzy Matching<br/>Quite often we have to link datasets by text fields, in which the same information is represented in different ways.<br/>We will consider several test cases for the problem of linking various datasets:<\/p> <p>linking of datasets by text fields with meaningful information,<br/>linking of datasets with short text fields with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names),<br/>linking of a dataset with unstructured text with a dataset with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names).<br/>We will discuss the theory, look into the relevant R packages, and outline the applications in insurance.<br/>Speaker 3:<br/>Martin Binder, creator of the mlr3piplines package,<br/>mlr3: Machine Learning, Pipelines, and AutoML in R<br/>One of R's strong points for data science is the availability of many different machine learning algorithms and implementations. This diversity, however, comes at the cost of inconsistent APIs, which often require writing custom glue code for everyday tasks such as resampling or data preprocessing. 'mlr3' and accompanying packages remedy this by offering a uniform interface to many machine learning methods, while at the same time providing a broad range of further functionality.<br/>We will present the possibilities offered by 'mlr3': From basics like model fitting and inference, over model performance evaluation, benchmarking, and hyperparameter tuning, to the capability to build complex data pre- and post-processing pipelines with simple building blocks and a natural data flow paradigm. Finally, we will provide links to further resources on how mlr3 can be used most effectively.<\/p> ",

With huge amount of data becoming a norm nowadays, having both features are ideal to attack problems related to data science and machine learning. This talk will demonstrate how Julia and R features and packages can be used as complementary utilities to solve real problems. The approach adapts the unix pipeline workflow of solving problems by stitching together a set of small utilities from JuliaR that when combined in a certain way becomes an optimal solution to the problem. These small utilities if properly designed encourages reusability, seamless integration of Julia and R utils, and easy explainability of the entire workflow.<\/p> <p># Sponsor<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an advanced analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.

    "description": "<p>We have 3 confirmed lightning presentations for December's meetup!<br/>Additional details to be provided.<\/p> <p>Talk 1:<br/>Title: Advancing pre-clinical research with R and cloud computing<br/>Presented by Nobal Dhruw, Sabu George, Shashank Jatav<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>R has been the popular tool of choice for performing bioinformatics analysis by researchers in the drug discovery space given the availability of many open-source packages and libraries in the public domain. These open-source tools enable researchers to analyze and generate insights from their biomedical data. Typically, the analysis and the consumption of insights is done via an interactive web interface powered by shiny, an R package to build web-apps. However, our experience developing traditional shiny apps for biological (omics) data analysis, has exposed to us problems related to the handling of voluminous datasets, and the associated computationally expensive jobs, typical characteristics of biological data. Then, there is also the problem of workflow customisability, as a shiny app is often built to cater to one specific use case. But it is often desired to have a certain degree of flexibility and customisability in-built into the system, which would allow the end-users themselves to create their own workflow by stitching together the atomic components. Here, we describe how we have leveraged cloud computing services to mitigate these issues and create an infrastructure which would enable the bioinformaticians to perform data analysis in an easy and intuitive manner, and at the same time giving them the liberty to package their R code as a custom component, without having to worry about how to make their code production-ready. Our infrastructure platform manages the allocation of machine resources required to execute the component.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Nobal Dhruw (Sr. Data Scientist, Elucidata)<br/>Sabu George (Tech Lead, Elucidata)<br/>Shashank Jatav (Sr. Data Scientist, Elucidata)<\/p> <p>Talk #2:<br/>R and SQLite: A Winning Combination<br/>Presented by Bryan Cafferky<\/p> <p>R is an awesome data analysis language. SQLite is the most popular relational database on the planet. Why not use them together? In this presentation, Bryan will explain how persisting data to a SQLite database with R can greatly enhance your data analysis and machine learning development. Best of all, it's easy to use.

    "description": "<p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.li/H0BvQkk0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.li/H0BvQkk0<\/a><\/p> <p>As providers of an end-to-end MLOps platform, we find that autoscaling ML inference is a frequent customer ask. Recently, serverless computing has been touted as the panacea for elastic compute that can provide flexibility and lower operating costs. However, for ML, the need to precisely define hardware configurations and long warm-up times of certain ML models exacerbate the limitations of serverless. To provide the best solution to our customers, we have run extensive benchmarking experiments comparing the performance of serverless and traditional computing for inference workloads running on Kubernetes (with KubeFlow and with the ModelDB MLOps Toolkit). Our experiments have spanned a variety of model types, data modalities, hardware, and workloads. In this talk, we present the results from our benchmarking study and provide a guide to architect your own k8s-based ML inference system.<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.li/H0BvQkk0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.li/H0BvQkk0<\/a><\/p> ",

Talk: 16:00 Anton Antonov, dxFeed Solutions GmbH, R in linguistic studies<\/p> <p>I have always known that linguistics and mathematics have a lot in common. Still I was surprised to discover the true extent of that similarity. The complexity, the aesthetics, seemingly impossible problems that are resolved by establishing intrinsic relations between abstract objects... Finally, the helpfulness of R in dealing with these challenges.<\/p> <p>In this obviously non-serious talk I will be speaking about my amateurish attempts at passing a particularly complex online course in linguistics using only my head, a pen, a sheet of paper and R.<\/p> <p>### 2. Talk: 16:30 Alexey Osipov, Sidenis, Linking via Fuzzy Matching.<\/p> <p>Quite often we have to link datasets by text fields, in which the same information is represented in different ways.<\/p> <p>We will consider several test cases for the problem of linking of various datasets:<\/p> <p>1) linking of datasets by text fields with meaningful information,<\/p> <p>2) linking of datasets with short text fields with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names),<\/p> <p>3) linking of a dataset with unstructured text with a dataset with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names).<\/p> <p>We will discuss the theory, look into the relevant R packages, and outline the applications in insurance.<\/p> <p>### 3. Talk: 17:00 Martin Binder, developer of mlr3pipelines, mlr3: Machine Learning, Pipelines and AutoML in R<\/p> <p>One of R's strong points for data science is the availability of many different machine learning algorithms and implementations. This diversity, however, comes at the cost of inconsistent APIs, which often require writing custom glue code for everyday tasks such as resampling or data preprocessing. 'mlr3' and accompanying packages remedy this by offering a uniform interface to many machine learning methods, while at the same time providing a broad range of further functionality.<\/p> <p>We will present the possibilities offered by 'mlr3': From basics like model fitting and inference, over model performance evaluation, benchmarking and hyperparameter tuning, to the capability to build complex data pre- and post-processing pipelines with simple building blocks and a natural data flow paradigm. Finally, we will provide links to further resources on how mlr3 can be used most effectively.<\/p> ",

Samples of dynamic or time-varying networks and other random object data such as time-varying probability distributions are increasingly encountered in modern data analysis.<\/p> <p>However, common methods for time-varying data such as functional data analysis are infeasible when observations are time courses of networks or other complex non-Euclidean random objects that are elements of general metric spaces. In such spaces, only pairwise distances between the data objects are available and a strong limitation is that one cannot carry out arithmetic operations due to the lack of an algebraic structure.<\/p> <p>We combat this complexity by a generalized notion of mean trajectory taking values in the object space. For this, we adopt pointwise Fréchet means and then construct pointwise distance trajectories between the individual time courses and the estimated Fréchet mean trajectory, thus representing the time-varying objects and networks by functional data. Functional principal component analysis of these distance trajectories can reveal interesting features of dynamic networks and object time courses and is useful for downstream analysis.<\/p> <p>Our approach also makes it possible to study the empirical dynamics of time-varying objects, including dynamic regression to the mean or explosive behavior over time. We demonstrate desirable asymptotic properties of sample based estimators for suitable population targets under mild assumptions. The utility of the proposed methodology is illustrated with both dynamic network and time-varying distribution data.<\/p> <p>#####<br/>Norm Matloff<br/>The Notion of Double Descent<\/p> <p>The notion of double descent, which has come into prominence in the last few years, is something I regard as genuinely new and very relevant, shedding important light on the central issue of model overfitting.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I’ll explain the idea, and illustrate it using code from my regtools R package. (Have a look at Norm's Post (<a href=\"https://matloff.wordpress.com/2020/11/11/the-notion-of-double-descent/#comments\" class=\"linkified\">https://matloff.wordpress.com/2020/11/11/the-notion-of-double-descent/#comments<\/a>) to prepare for the talk.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hello everyone! We would like to invite you to join a fellow R groups event organised online. Please see event details below:<\/p> <p>Topics:<br/>- R in linguistic studies<br/>- Linking via Fuzzy Matching<br/>- Machine Learning, Pipelines and AutoML in R<\/p> <p>## Applied R Munich Christmas Edition<\/p> <p>This year's Applied R Munich Christmas Edition will be held online as a joint Meetup with our friends from the St. Petersburg R User Group.<\/p> <p>Thanks to JetBrains for the support in organizing the virtual event.<\/p> <p>Please, don't hesitate to contact us at [masked] (or via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/applied_r\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/applied_r<\/a>) if your company would be willing to host one of our next meetups or if you have an interesting talk about an R related topic that you would like to present in a Meetup.<\/p> <p>## Agenda for the Meetup<\/p> <p>### 1. Talk: 16:00 Anton Antonov, dxFeed Solutions GmbH, R in linguistic studies<\/p> <p>I have always known that linguistics and mathematics have a lot in common. Still I was surprised to discover the true extent of that similarity. The complexity, the aesthetics, seemingly impossible problems that are resolved by establishing intrinsic relations between abstract objects... Finally, the helpfulness of R in dealing with these challenges.<\/p> <p>In this obviously non-serious talk I will be speaking about my amateurish attempts at passing a particularly complex online course in linguistics using only my head, a pen, a sheet of paper and R.<\/p> <p>### 2. Talk: 16:30 Alexey Osipov, Sidenis, Linking via Fuzzy Matching.<\/p> <p>Quite often we have to link datasets by text fields, in which the same information is represented in different ways.<\/p> <p>We will consider several test cases for the problem of linking of various datasets:<\/p> <p>1) linking of datasets by text fields with meaningful information,<\/p> <p>2) linking of datasets with short text fields with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names),<\/p> <p>3) linking of a dataset with unstructured text with a dataset with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names).<\/p> <p>We will discuss the theory, look into the relevant R packages, and outline the applications in insurance.<\/p> <p>### 3. Talk: 17:00 Martin Binder, developer of mlr3pipelines, mlr3: Machine Learning, Pipelines and AutoML in R<\/p> <p>One of R's strong points for data science is the availability of many different machine learning algorithms and implementations. This diversity, however, comes at the cost of inconsistent APIs, which often require writing custom glue code for everyday tasks such as resampling or data preprocessing. 'mlr3' and accompanying packages remedy this by offering a uniform interface to many machine learning methods, while at the same time providing a broad range of further functionality.<\/p> <p>We will present the possibilities offered by 'mlr3': From basics like model fitting and inference, over model performance evaluation, benchmarking and hyperparameter tuning, to the capability to build complex data pre- and post-processing pipelines with simple building blocks and a natural data flow paradigm. Finally, we will provide links to further resources on how mlr3 can be used most effectively.<\/p> ",

We will hear from Gabriela de Queiroz, founder of R-Ladies and AI Inclusive. Gabriela will tell us about her career journey, as well as the many different roles a Data Scientist may have.<\/p> <p>At the end of the meeting, there will be time to ask any questions you may have about data scientist careers or questions about R in general.<\/p> <p>Don't forget to RSVP in our Meetup to get access to the meeting's ID and password.<\/p> <p>Big thanks to UCR Library and UCR GradQuant for supporting us.<\/p> <p>See you soon!<\/p> <p>## Details<\/p> <p>~ Data Science as a Team Sport ~<\/p> <p>Data Science careers are in high demand, with many job opportunities and attractive salaries. As a relatively new career, it is ambiguously defined, and the job description of a data scientist can vary greatly from company to company. For those reasons, Data Science has attracted both new grads and career changers from all sorts of different fields. For Statisticians, Data Science is an exciting opportunity to apply your hard-earned skills to a variety of interesting and challenging problems. Having a solid Statistics background will give you a head start in that direction. However, Data Science is much more than pure Statistics knowledge. Being able to recognize and take advantage of a team with a diverse set of experiences will provide you with a unique opportunity to grow individually while benefiting your entire team. In this talk, I will walk you through my career journey, the different roles a Data Scientist can take, useful skills for a successful career, and lessons learned.<\/p> <p>~ Bio ~<br/>Gabriela de Queiroz is a Sr. Engineering &amp; Data Science Manager at IBM where she manages and leads a team of developers working on Data &amp; AI Open Source projects.<br/>She works to democratize AI by building tools and launching new open source projects. She is passionate about making data science available to everybody and is actively involved with several organizations to foster an inclusive community.<br/>She is the founder of AI Inclusive (ai-inclusive.org), a global organization that is helping increase the representation and participation of gender minorities in Artificial Intelligence. She is also the founder of R-Ladies (rladies.org), a worldwide organization for promoting diversity in the R community with more than 180 chapters in 50+ countries.<br/>She has worked in several startups and where she built teams, developed statistical models, and employed a variety of techniques to derive insights and drive data-centric decisions.<br/>She likes to mentor and shares her knowledge through mentorship programs, tutorials, and talks.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hi, everybody!<br/>We hope that you and your family are doing well. We are super excited to have Erin, co-founder of R-Ladies global, founder of the Women in Machine Learning and Data Science and Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai to bring you a workshop on Automatic and Explainable Machine Learning in R with H2O!<\/p> <p>DESCRIPTION<br/>----------------------<\/p> <p>H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning platform is designed to scale to very large datasets. H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface which automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models from a single function, `h2o.automl()`. The result of the AutoML run is a \"leaderboard\" of H2O models, which can be then be explained automatically using the H2O Explainability interface.<\/p> <p>The models can be explained individually, and also compared as a group and both global (model-wise) and local (row-wise) explainations are available. The `h2o.explain()` function generates a list of explanations – individual units of explanation such as a Partial Dependence plot or a Variable Importance plot. Most of the explanations are visual – these plots can also be created by individual utility functions outside the `h2o.explain()` function. The visualization engine used in the R interface is the ggplot2 package and in Python, we use matplotlib.<\/p> <p>R code with a full demo will be provided, which can be used to automatically train and explain models on your own dataset.<\/p> <p>PROGRAMME<br/>----------------------<br/>[masked] Virtual Welcome<br/>19.05- 20.30 Talk &amp; Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>ABOUT ERIN<br/>----------------------<br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-ledell/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-ledell/<\/a><br/>Erin LeDell is the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, the company that produces the open source, distributed machine learning platform, H2O. At H2O.ai, she leads the H2O AutoML project and her current research focus is automated machine learning. Before joining H2O.ai, she was the Principal Data Scientist at Wise.io (acquired by GE) and Marvin Mobile Security (acquired by Veracode), the founder of DataScientific, Inc. and a software engineer.

    "description": "<p>本次聚會地點於三創育成基金會（11F）場地<\/p> <p>講題：Recommendation Systems in Real Life<\/p> <p>講題介紹：<br/>Recommendation systems are used everywhere nowadays. This talk will discuss how differently recommendation systems are researched and applied in academia and industry, and challenges one might face or criteria one might care about when building recommendation systems. In real life, the job of a recommendation algorithm is not to be very predictive of past held-out interactions but is to be predictive of future interactions. What is really important is its performance after being deployed, which is in the future. In addition, users change over time, items change over time, even the system around the recommendation algorithm is going to change over time, which might impact things and need to be considered. In this talk, we will talk about how we tackle some of these challenges and recent trends in personalization at Netflix.<\/p> <p>講者介紹：<br/>Ko-Jen (Mark) Hsiao is a senior research scientist at Netflix, where he researches and implements innovative algorithms to optimize Netflix's core personalization. He has extensive experiences in applying machine learning at scale, building and A/B testing ranking and recommendation systems. Before he joined Netflix, he was a data scientist at Whisper, an anonymous social network app with over 30 million monthly active users. He developed and implemented several end-to-end machine learning systems used by the company. He obtained his PhD from the University of Michigan, where he focused on combining disparate information for machine learning applications.<br/>www.linkedin.com/in/markhsiao/<\/p> ",

If you would like to attend the event but the registration fee would put a financial strain on you, please reach out to [masked]. There are a limited number of complimentary tickets available.<\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundational knowledge to effectively use some powerful regression models used by data scientists. When data are collected on the same subjects repeatedly over time (for example, in clinical trials or cohort studies) or under different conditions (for example, in a designed experiment), the measurements within the same individual are modeled as having correlated values. At the workshop, we will consider several models that can be employed to model a normally distributed response variable. The models that we will consider are: random slope and intercept (mixed-effects) model and generalized estimating equations models with unstructured, autoregressive, compound symmetric (exchangeable), and independent working correlation matrices. All models will be run in R version 4.0.3.<\/p> <p>The course will be structured as follows. For each part, we will first discuss the theory, then work through an example. After that, the participants will work in small groups in break-out rooms to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material. All the files and Rstudio will be made available to the participants.<\/p> <p>We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be setup and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.<\/p> <p>The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book “Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications” (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/<\/a>), CRC Press, 2018.<\/p> <p># About the Instructor<br/>Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB).

Here is my proposal:<\/p> <p>- Gather a small group of 2-5 and learn together.<br/>- Meet at a coffee shop, library, or some other space that has Wi-Fi.<br/>- Pick a project, data set or problem, then work to solve it with different tools.<br/>- Keep it fluid and informal.<br/>- Meet on a regular basis, say weekly to start, and adjust as needed.<br/>- Aim to keep the meetings 2-4 hours long, but this can be adjusted to the project or group. People can come and go as needed.<br/>- It does not have to be the same people each time, so you only have to commit to going once to check it out.<\/p> <p>Are you interested? Show up at the meeting spot, have some coffee, meet new friends and bring a project or question.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Date:[masked]:15pm CET<\/p> <p>Make It or Break It - How Product Analytics Helps Building Software Products<\/p> <p>Ever since Data Science was deemed as the sexiest job of the 21st century by HBR in the early 2010s, everyone is obsessed with building the coolest, shiniest, most complex machine learning algorithms available. And rightfully so — it is super exciting and can be mind-bending at times. However, in the past 3.5 years, I have realized that it's all nice and stuff but unless you have the basics covered, your awesome recommending engine won't do much for your product. So I have worked with my stakeholders to understand our consumers and how we can build a product that suits their needs - and maybe even makes their life a little bit better. I will talk about how to measure the success of a software product through real-life examples, and how to deal with stakeholders used to listening to their gut - or fixated on building a complex model for a simple task.<\/p> <p>### Registration<\/p> <p>Registration link: <a href=\"https://x-europe-with-anna-szell.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://x-europe-with-anna-szell.carrd.co/<\/a><br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>WATCH OUT!

Many tools exist to quantify and compare abundance levels or composition of bacterial communities in different conditions. The sequencing reads have to be denoised and assigned to the closest taxa from a reference database. By providing a complete workflow in R, we enable the user to do sophisticated downstream statistical analyses, whether parametric or nonparametric. We provide examples of using the R packages dada2, phyloseq, DESeq2, ggplot2, structSSI and vegan to filter, visualize and test microbiome data. We also provide examples of supervised analyses using random forests and nonparametric testing using community networks and the ggnetwork and ggraph packages.<\/p> <p># Speaker<br/>Trained in the French school of Data Analysis in Montpellier, Susan Holmes has been working in non parametric multivariate statistics applied to Biology since 1985. She has taught at MIT, Harvard and was an Associate Professor of Biometry at Cornell before moving to Stanford in 1998. She created the Thinking Matters class: Breaking Codes and Finding patterns and likes working on big messy data sets, mostly from the areas of Immunology, Cancer Biology and Microbial Ecology. Her theoretical interests include applied probability, MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov chains), Graph Limit Theory, Differential Geometry and the topology of the space of Phylogenetic Trees. She wrote the book Modern Statistics for Modern Biology with Wolfgang Huber from EMBL and teaches the material as a crash course (BIOS221) regularly every year. Her current focus is improving the statistical analyses and reproducibility of data in perturbation studies of the Human Microbiome.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning. <a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jumping_uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/jumping_uk<\/a><br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>[Abstract]<br/>The {brms} package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using Stan, a C++ package for performing full Bayesian inference (see <a href=\"https://mc-stan.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://mc-stan.org/<\/a>). The formula syntax is very similar to that of the {lme4} package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p>[Bio]<br/>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany). He is the author of the R package {brms} and member of the Stan Development Team. Previously, he studied Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen (Germany) and did his PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. He has also worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University (Finland).<\/p> <p>[About]<br/>This event is organized by the Oslo useR!

When you write R packages, you also unlock a whole ecosystem of tools that will make it easier to test, document, and share your code. Despite these benefits, many believe package development is too advanced for them or that they have nothing to offer. A fundamental belief in Zen is that you are already complete, that you already have everything you need. I’ll talk about why your project is already an R package, why you’re already an R package developer, and why you already have the skills to walk the path of development.<\/p> <p>Bio<br/>Malcolm is a Clinical Research Data Scientist at Teladoc Health, an epidemiologist, an R developer and also an organizer for the Los Angeles R Users Group. Malcolm is the author of several R packages, including ggdag and precisely. Previously, he was an intern at RStudio and spent two years of service in AmeriCorps. In 2013 and 2014, while serving in AmeriCorps, Malcolm lived in the Zen Center of New York City, where he is still a student.<\/p> <p>####<br/>Rongkui Han<\/p> <p>Title: Probability Calibration in Multiclass Classification<br/>In classification problems, the accurate estimation of posterior probabilities of the class labels is highly valuable. Not all the machine learning algorithms can provide good estimates of the class probabilities. Some, such as SVM, do not provide any estimates. As a result, probability calibration is needed. A popular calibration method for binary classification is Platt scaling, a parametric method that assumes a logistic model for class probability given the classification score generated by SVM.<\/p> <p>Other non-parametric methods for probability calibration in the binary case include isotonic regression, Bayesian binning into quantiles (BBQ), ensemble of linear trend estimation (ELiTE), and Jittering the training data, along with over/under-sampling (JOUS).<\/p> <p>Here, we introduce a polynomial extension of Platt scaling and a new probability calibration method based on k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). We compare the performance of the aforementioned existing methods and our new methods in the context of multiclass classification, using real and simulated datasets.<\/p> <p>#### Kenneth Lee<br/>Impact of US government interventions during COVID 19 pandemic: seen through mobility<\/p> <p>Mobility is one of the potential factors in contributing to the spread of COVID-19. In this talk we describe our work to estimate the effect of state-wide policies on mobility signals at a county-level. We do so by using a regression discontinuity design to compare the difference in mobility signals before and after interventions. Also, we examine the correlation between the magnitude of the effect and the county-level demographic data. Based on assumptions, we have found that a mandatory COVID19 policy tends to be more effective in the areas with a large population, a small percentage of people in poverty, a high percent of people with education backgrounds, and a low unemployment rate.<\/p> ",

Ama i dati e la tecnologia, sperimentare e mettersi alla prova. Durante il Master in Data Science ha scoperto la sua vera passione: raccontare i dati. Specializzata in R, data analytics e data visualization, ha ottenuto di recente la certificazione Tableau Desktop Specialist. Il suo mantra è: non temere il fallimento perché è una delle più grosse opportunità per la crescita personale e professionale. Molto sensibile verso il tema della diversità e inclusione nel Tech, è co-fondatrice di #RladiesItaly il cui scopo è sostenere le donne nel settore della data science e data analytics e renderle protagoniste dando voce alle loro aspirazioni e obiettivi.<\/p> <p>Sara Iacozza - Data literacy e storytelling, BI analyst, UX research. “Ho un dottorato di ricerca in neuroscienze cognitive e amo i dati perchè mi danno l’opportunità di capire meglio il comportamento delle persone. Il mio obiettivo è offrire informazioni che siano basate su evidenza e non opinioni. Ho diversi anni di esperienza nel disegnare e portare a termine progetti di ricerca volti a rispondere a esigenze di varia natura. Dal mio punto di vista, le migliori risposte arrivano attraverso un processo che si chiama ​participatory design​, attraverso il quale supporto i diversi stakeholders interessati in un progetto a definire un problema comune. #RLadiesItaly è la realizzazione di un sogno che vede donne e minoranze supportarsi vicendevolmente in un campo che è ancora fortemente maschile é il desiderio di dare senso a quelle ​quote rosa​ tanto, ingiustamente, criticate nel nostro paese.”<\/p> <p>Parvaneh Shafiei - Senior Data scientist con +6 anni di esperienza nell'applicazione della Data science e del Machine Learning in vari settori. Lei ha studiato informatica al politecnico di milano. Ha trascorso la maggior parte della sua carriera in società di consulenza per aiutare vari clienti a lanciare e implementare progetti di Machine learning, attualmente è Project Leader in NTT data. È la fondatrice di RladiesMilan, un gruppo dedicato per dare visibilità alle ragazze che lavorano nel settore della tecnologia e della Data science e far crescere più diversità<\/p> <p>Diletta Milana - Data Scientist in ENI<\/p> <p>-----------------<\/p> <p>L'evento è organizzato in partnership con R-Ladies Italy un progetto congiunto tra R-Ladies Bari e R-Ladies Milan, due chapter locali di R-Ladies global. Il loro obiettivo è supportare le donne e le minoranze di genere sottorappresentate nella data science e data analytics. Le donne sono le assolute protagoniste dei loro webinar e vogliono dar loro voce e spazio per raccontare le loro esperienze, ambizioni e obiettivi. Vogliono creare un luogo metafisico di supporto e condivisione. Si concentriano in particolare sul mostrare alle persone che, anche in campi non tradizionalmente legati al mondo della data science, forti competenze sull’analisi dei dati e una mentalità data-driven possono essere una risorsa inestimabile.<\/p> ",

We hope this will foster our understanding of git/github, and be a little fun, too.<\/p> <p>There is no need to prepare anything, but you might want to set up a github account prior to the meeting.

    "group": "R-Ladies Philly",
    "start": "2021-01-13",
    "description": "<p>This introduction to Shiny Dashboards is for people who are interested in creating multi-Shiny app dashboards in R using the “shinydashboard” package. Topics such as reactivity, appearance (i.e. dashboard themes), profiling, and deployment will be covered. Over the course of the workshop, users will learn how to go from a raw data file to a working multi-app dashboard that can be updated based on user input.<\/p> <p>The workshop will be suitable for beginner to intermediate R users or for those who are new to dashboard and app development. Former experience with Shiny is not necessary for this workshop. Some familiarity with R and/or data visualization methods would be helpful and assumed but not required, so novice users are encouraged to attend.<\/p> <p>Speaker<\/p> <p>Anastasia Lucas is a data analyst working in biomedical informatics and computational genomics research at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine. Her work in R mainly focuses on statistical analysis, package development, and data visualization.<\/p> <p>Online Meetup Capacity: 100 attendees<\/p> <p>Please note that the meetup link can support up to 100 attendees. While we won't cap the number of RSVPs, we encourage you to be on time to secure a spot.

Group (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/StockholmR/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/StockholmR/<\/a>).<\/p> <p>[Abstract]<br/>The {brms} package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using Stan, a C++ package for performing full Bayesian inference (see <a href=\"https://mc-stan.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://mc-stan.org/<\/a>). The formula syntax is very similar to that of the {lme4} package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p>[Bio]<br/>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany). He is the author of the R package {brms} and member of the Stan Development Team. Previously, he studied Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen (Germany) and did his PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. He has also worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University (Finland).<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hello everyone! We would like to invite you to join a fellow R group event organised online. Please see event details below:<\/p> <p>Details<br/>[About]<br/>This event is organized by the Oslo useR! Group (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/<\/a>) and will be co-hosted by the Skåne useR! Group (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Skane-R-User-Group/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Skane-R-User-Group/<\/a>), the Copenhagen useR! Group (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/CopenhagenR-useR-Group/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/CopenhagenR-useR-Group/<\/a>), and the Stockholm useR! Group (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/StockholmR/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/StockholmR/<\/a>).<\/p> <p>[Abstract]<br/>The {brms} package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using Stan, a C++ package for performing full Bayesian inference (see <a href=\"https://mc-stan.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://mc-stan.org/<\/a>). The formula syntax is very similar to that of the {lme4} package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p>[Bio]<br/>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany). He is the author of the R package {brms} and member of the Stan Development Team. Previously, he studied Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen (Germany) and did his PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. He has also worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University (Finland).<\/p> ",

Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.<\/p> <p>Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance-operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond-understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance.<\/p> <p>An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

Many tools exist to quantify and compare abundance levels or composition of bacterial communities in different conditions. The sequencing reads have to be denoised and assigned to the closest taxa from a reference database. By providing a complete workflow in R, we enable the user to do sophisticated downstream statistical analyses, whether parametric or nonparametric. We provide examples of using the R packages dada2, phyloseq, DESeq2, ggplot2, structSSI and vegan to filter, visualize and test microbiome data. We also provide examples of supervised analyses using random forests and nonparametric testing using community networks and the ggnetwork and ggraph packages.<\/p> <p># Speaker<br/>Trained in the French school of Data Analysis in Montpellier, Susan Holmes has been working in non parametric multivariate statistics applied to Biology since 1985. She has taught at MIT, Harvard and was an Associate Professor of Biometry at Cornell before moving to Stanford in 1998. She created the Thinking Matters class: Breaking Codes and Finding patterns and likes working on big messy data sets, mostly from the areas of Immunology, Cancer Biology and Microbial Ecology. Her theoretical interests include applied probability, MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov chains), Graph Limit Theory, Differential Geometry and the topology of the space of Phylogenetic Trees. She wrote the book Modern Statistics for Modern Biology with Wolfgang Huber from EMBL and teaches the material as a crash course (BIOS221) regularly every year.

So how do you get your R scripts to run? In this talk I hope to inspire lone data scientists on all the ways you can run your Rscript in the cloud. I cover some simple and more advanced use cases for running R in the cloud. I also talk about cooperating with IT for maximum results.<\/p> <p># Speaker<br/>I'm a maker, I love to build useful (machine learning) tools for people and I love sharing what I learned. I have been working in researcher, data scientist and machine learning engineer roles for the past years. I want to make it easy, convenient and simple for everyone to run their R work in the cloud. I also really like dogs, my girlfriend and I are getting one soon!<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t47U_nBXdE\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t47U_nBXdE<\/a><\/p> ",
