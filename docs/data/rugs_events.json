The talk begins with a discussion of fundamental command-line topics like managing output streams, exit codes, and environment variables. After that, the talk will explain each argument to the \"Rscript\" executable. The talk will then describe how to write your own R programs that take in command-line arguments, using builtin functions like `commandArgs()` and external packages like {argparse} and {crayon}. The talk concludes with a demo of two R command-line interfaces used in the {lightgbm} project: one for running linting with {lintr} in continuous integration and one for building a C++ library using CMake. Sample code will be available on GitHub prior to and following the talk.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: James Lamb<\/p> <p>James Lamb is an engineer at Saturn Cloud, where he works on a team building a managed Dask + Kubernetes product. He is a maintainer on {lightgbm}, and has made many contributions to other open source data science projects, including {xgboost} and prefect. He is also a maintainer and co-author of two other packages on CRAN: {pkgnet} and {uptasticsearch}. He holds masters degrees in Applied Economics (2014) and Data Science (2018). Before joining Saturn, he worked as an IoT Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services and Uptake.<\/p> <p>**Talk 2**<\/p> <p>While working remotely, I often have client projects where RStudio is unavailable for data security reasons or otherwise. R is feature-rich environment for terminal users as well, and I will discuss the underappreciated<br/>functions around highlighting, graphics, editor integration, and other nice-to-haves for day-to-day<br/>usage of the terminal.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: Neal Fultz<\/p> <p>Neal Fultz is a long-time friend of the LA RUG/Tech community.

It is a weekend-long event.<\/p> <p>During this event, we will be exploring an interesting data set, starting from the raw data all the way through to a final \"end product\" (e.g. a data visualization, an interesting data insight, a predictive model, etc.).<\/p> <p>This event is open to all experience levels, from the complete beginner to the highly experienced. Participants will work in teams to \"hack\" through the data and will present their work at the end of the event for prizes. You are free to create your own team, or we will assist in team creation if you do not have one. This is a great way to network, share, and learn from others.<\/p> <p>The main goal of the hackathon is to promote teamwork and foster education and learning in a welcoming environment. Though teams will be competing to present their best work at the end of the event for prizes, communication and providing assistance across teams is highly encouraged. We will provide in-person training during the hackathon and online training prior to the event.<\/p> <p>We have set up a GitHub repository that has more information about the hackathon. Such as the schedule; setting up slack and much more. Further information will be provided prior to the event.<\/p> <p>All participants must abide by the OCRUG Code of Conduct and R Consortium Code of Conduct.<\/p> <p>This will be an online event.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Are you looking to improve our R skills? Come just us for a book club. It will be headed up by John Peach. The idea is to motivate us to read books and discussing them together. This will help all of us to develop our skills.<\/p> <p>The format will be that the leader will prepare a short summary of the material and present it to the group. We will then discuss the material and do some exercises.<\/p> <p>The expectations are that you will attend regularly. If you cannot make a commitment to attend, please wait until the next book club starts. It is also expected that participants will take turns being the leader. The leader should prepare a summary of the material that was read and present it to the group.<\/p> <p>We will meet each week, Monday evening between 6:30 and 8:00 PM for six weeks.<\/p> <p>Book: Title: Text Mining with R<br/>Online: <a href=\"https://www.tidytextmining.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tidytextmining.com/<\/a><br/>Dead Tree: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491981652/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491981652/<\/a><\/p> <p>Signing up: When you sign-up you will be placed on the waiting list.

    "description": "<p>MEETUP DESCRIPTION<\/p> <p>In an effort to be data driven, many organizations are looking to democratize data. However, they often struggle with increasingly larger data volumes, reverting back to bottlenecking data access to manage large numbers of data engineering requests and rising data warehousing costs. To address this, a next-gen cloud data lake architecture has emerged that brings together the best attributes of the data warehouse and the data lake. This new open data architecture is built to maximize data access with minimal data movement and no data copies.<\/p> <p>- How “no data copy” approach dramatically streamlines data workflows while reducing security and governance overhead<br/>- Why agile development concepts, when applied to the data tier, can dramatically increase data engineering agility<br/>- How to separate compute and data by preserving data in open file and table formats<br/>- How a next-generation cloud data lake architecture brings together the best attributes of data warehouse and data lakes to truly democratize data<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://apache-arrow-datalake.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://apache-arrow-datalake.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Viktor Kessler<br/>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktor-kessler/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktor-kessler/<\/a><br/>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ViktorKessler\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/ViktorKessler<\/a><\/p> <p>Viktor Kessler is Senior Solutions Architect at Dremio and a ex-MongoDB Senior Solutions Architect.<\/p> <p>### ABOUT THE X-EUROPE DATA SCIENCE WEBINARS<\/p> <p>X-Europe Webinar Series is a joint online event of Vienna Data Science Group, Frankfurt Data Science, Budapest Data Science Meetup, BCN Analytics, Budapest.AI, Barcelona Data Science and Machine Learning Meetup, Budapest Deep Learning Reading Seminar, Warsaw R Users Group, PyData Slovakia, and Data Scientists Ireland.<\/p> ",

This type of work often involves trade processing, trade confirmation, and settlement of payments. In many institutions, much of this work is done manually using excel spreadsheets. This presentation will focus on how someone in the back-office can use R to automate manual processes and how they might convince others on their team to join the journey.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Mandip Mistry is a Business Analyst at the Health Care of Ontario Pension Plan. In his role, he is responsible for enhancements and ongoing support of HOOPP's internal stress testing system which provides risk reporting to a variety of stakeholders within the organization. Before this, he spent 5 years in Investment Operations (aka back-office) helping automate manual excel processes while developing a healthy obsession for all things R. Mandip is also a certified tidyverse instructor currently working with back and middle office staff who have fallen out of love with Excel.<\/p> <p>This is a cross-post from the group here: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/RStudio-Enterprise-Community-Meetup\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/RStudio-Enterprise-Community-Meetup<\/a><\/p> <p>You can RSVP here on the Boston group though and don't have to join the group above, well unless you want to :)<\/p> ",

In my presentation, I will show you three small projects I conducted related to the pandemic, and look for your feedback. First, I analyzed COVID-19 case trends across the State of Washington, particularly in Spokane, in order for myself to see behind daily case counts, and still looking for ways to expand that. Second, I tested the oft-heard suggestion that increased case numbers in the fall of 2020 were simply due to increased testing, using bootstrapping methods. Finally, I developed a stochastic, spatially explicit model to simulate COVID-19 transmission within a facility, such as a dorm, with visualization conducted in R.<\/p> <p>Speaker Profile: Krisztian Magori,Ph.D., is a Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Department of Biology at Eastern Washington University. He teaches biostatistics using R at both the undergraduate and graduate level, and consults with faculty and students on statistical analysis of their datasets. In addition, he is a disease ecologist, focusing on ticks and mosquitoes, when we don't have a pandemic that's more important.<\/p> ",

Such a graphical representation is convenient, since, for high-dimensional problems the local interpretation of a subset of variables can be interpreted in the sub-graph induced by these variables and variables connected to these. By exploiting the graph-theoretic representation, general algorithms can be used for computing marginal and conditional probabilities. For problems large enough, it can be impossible to compute such probabilities without exploiting the graphical representation. Of particular importance for calculations of probabilities in graphical models is the Junction Tree Algorithm (JTA).<\/p> ",

Such a graphical representation is convenient, since, for high-dimensional problems the local interpretation of a subset of variables can be interpreted in the sub-graph induced by these variables and variables connected to these. By exploiting the graph-theoretic representation, general algorithms can be used for computing marginal and conditional probabilities. For problems large enough, it can be impossible to compute such probabilities without exploiting the graphical representation. Of particular importance for calculations of probabilities in graphical models is the Junction Tree Algorithm (JTA).<\/p> ",

His background spans from biotechnology to bioinformatics and biostatistics. His research focuses on prostate and breast tumour microenvironment, the development of statistical model for the analysis of RNA sequencing data, and data analysis and visualisation interfaces.<\/p> <p>▶️ About Dr. Maria Doyle:<br/>Dr. Maria Doyle is the Application and Training Specialist for Research Computing at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia. She has a PhD in Molecular Biology and currently works in bioinformatics and data science education and training. She is passionate about supporting researchers, reproducible research, open source and tidy data.<\/p> <p>▶️ About the workshop:<\/p> <p>This workshop will present how to perform analysis of RNA sequencing data following the tidy data paradigm (Wickham and others 2014). The tidy data paradigm provides a standard way to organise data values within a dataset, where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and data is manipulated using an easy-to-understand vocabulary. Most importantly, the data structure remains consistent across manipulation and analysis functions.<br/>This can be achieved for RNA sequencing data with the tidybulk, tidyHeatmap (Mangiola and Papenfuss 2020) and tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) packages. The tidybulk package provides a tidy data structure and a modular framework for bulk transcriptional analyses. tidyHeatmap provides a tidy implementation of ComplexHeatmap. These packages are part of the tidytranscriptomics suite that introduces a tidy approach to RNA sequencing data representation and analysis. The last section of the workshop will be focused on the analysis of single cell data in a tidy fashion with the packages tidySCE and tidyseurat.<\/p> <p>The topics presented in this workshop will be:<\/p> <p>▪️ Data exploration<br/>▪️ Data dimensionality reduction and clustering<br/>▪️ Differential gene expression analysis<br/>▪️ Data visualisation<\/p> <p>In order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉 <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y88sxkos\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/y88sxkos<\/a><\/p> <p>We will send you the Zoom link and the enter passcode a few hours before the training session.

The talk begins with a discussion of fundamental command-line topics like managing output streams, exit codes, and environment variables. After that, the talk will explain each argument to the \"Rscript\" executable. The talk will then describe how to write your own R programs that take in command-line arguments, using builtin functions like `commandArgs()` and external packages like {argparse} and {crayon}. The talk concludes with a demo of two R command-line interfaces used in the {lightgbm} project: one for running linting with {lintr} in continuous integration and one for building a C++ library using CMake.

Such a graphical representation is convenient, since, for high-dimensional problems the local interpretation of a subset of variables can be interpreted in the sub-graph induced by these variables and variables connected to these. By exploiting the graph-theoretic representation, general algorithms can be used for computing marginal and conditional probabilities. For problems large enough, it can be impossible to compute such probabilities without exploiting the graphical representation. Of particular importance for calculations of probabilities in graphical models is the Junction Tree Algorithm (JTA).<\/p> ",

We continue our meetups with #goodRvibes and a speaker you'll definitely enjoy!<\/p> <p>Three reasons to use tidymodels with Julia Silge<\/p> <p>Modeling and machine learning in R involve a bewildering array of heterogeneous packages, and establishing good statistical practice is challenging in any language. The tidymodels (tidymodels.org) collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, we’ll focus on three specific reasons to consider using tidymodels. We will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering.<\/p> <p>Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC where she works on open source modeling tools. She is an author, an international keynote speaker, and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice. Julia loves text analysis, making beautiful charts, and communicating about technical topics with diverse audiences.<\/p> <p>Registration is free, but mandatory via meetup. We shall meet on zoom, and the link will be updated on the day of the event ( PIN for entrance should be sent by email ~2hours before meeting start).<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>CODE OF CONDUCT :<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a><br/>Please read our Code of Conduct before your first participation.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Spend Friday night discussing Data Feminism (<a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/Data-Feminism-Catherine-DIgnazio/9780262044004\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.bookdepository.com/Data-Feminism-Catherine-DIgnazio/9780262044004<\/a>).<\/p> <p>A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism.<\/p> <p>Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.<\/p> <p>Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”<\/p> <p>Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed..<\/p> <p>PS This book is available free online: <a href=\"https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/<\/a><\/p> ",

The suggested donation is $50.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>Programming in Python is a six-hour workshop (across two days) that will introduce basic python syntax, data structures, and a few widely used python libraries.<\/p> <p>The workshop will focus on developing practical programming skills that are immediately applicable to data analysis and visualization. Topics covered include introductory python syntax (assigning variables, lists, slicing, conditionals, for loops, etc.), file parsing, analyzing tabular data using numpy, plotting data using matplotlib, and accessing data in pandas.<\/p> <p>The workshop is six-hours long, split over two days; it is important that participants attend both days.<\/p> <p>No prior programming experience is required.<\/p> <p>At the end of the workshop, self-paced curricular materials will be provided that cover more advanced topics like writing functions, curve fitting, testing with pytest, and more advanced data visualization techniques.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>Preparation steps for attendees:<\/p> <p>The workshop will be taught in a “live-coding” style where code is demonstrated live and you follow along, followed by examples and exercises to solidify your understanding. Note that since the you will want to be typing in your own jupyter notebook while watching the workshop, it is very helpful to have two screens so that you can watch the zoom meeting in one window and type in another window.<\/p> <p>While there are ways to access a programming environment online, I strongly recommend that you install python and set up a development environment on your own computer, so you can continue working in python after the workshop is over. These are the things you need to do to set up your computer to get ready for the workshop.<\/p> <p>1. Install anaconda. (<a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Anaconda is a python package manager. This means it is software that helps you install python and other python packages (we’ll talk more about what python packages are in the workshop). Go to the link above and download the appropriate package for your operating system. In virtually all cases, you want the 64-bit version and not the 32-bit. The default options are generally fine. If you are a windows user, be sure you choose Make anaconda the default python in the setup.<\/p> <p>2. Download the workshop files. (<a href=\"https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/data/data.zip\" class=\"linkified\">https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/data/data.zip<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Download the zip file linked above. Create a folder on your Desktop called python-workshop (use a dash or underscore in the name; do NOT use a space), move the zip file to your python-workshop folder, and unzip the file.<\/p> <p>3. Test your setup. From Finder or Spotlight (Mac OS) or the Start Menu (Windows) find the Anaconda Navigator. The icon looks like a green circle. Click Launch under Jupyter Notebook. It may take a few seconds to load the page, especially if it is the first time you have ever used the jupyter notebook, so don’t panic if nothing loads for a few seconds. Then a new window should open in your default internet browser. Use the file navigation window to navigate to Desktop and then to the python-workshop folder. In the upper right hand corner, click New, then choose Python 3 from the dropdown list. This should start a new jupyter notebook in python 3 and you are ready to go!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Are you interested in knowing more about R? R is one of the most popular programming languages for data analysis and visualization in fields from biology to banking. In this workshop, you will learn how to use R and R tools to create, load, plot, and analyze spatial data using an example that explores how animals are influenced by the physical world around them. Then, you will learn how to use R Shiny to display your data and analysis on an interactive web app ready for the internet.<br/>This workshop is aimed at attendees with beginner or higher level of programming experience in either R or another programming language. Attendees will benefit from familiarity with the concepts of assigning variables, subsetting arrays/matrices/data tables, and using predefined functions in their language of choice; but those unfamiliar with these concepts are welcome to follow along to see an example of what R can do!<\/p> <p>Jori Harrison is a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary where she studies how ecological factors influence environmental DNA. She has a BSc in Biochemistry, is a Professional Biologist with ASPB, and has over four years of experience as a wildlife genetics analyst with environmental consulting companies. She uses R regularly for statistical analysis, DNA sequence studies, and making pretty graphs with clicky buttons.<br/>Danielle Clake is a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary where she studies how bumble bee populations respond to different landscape characteristics. She has a BSc in Environmental Science and a MSc in Conservation biology, and over four years of experience as a geographic information systems (GIS) analyst for environmental consulting and wind power companies. She uses R regularly for statistical analysis and in spatial analyses of landscapes and bumble bee genetics.<\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>We are co-organising this workshop in collaboration with WiCS (Women in Computer Science at UofC). WiCS strives to enhance the learning experience of students through the facilitation of meaningful events and opportunities to learn and apply practical and professional skills.

No se utilizan fórmulas matemáticas, en un intento de hacerlo amigable e intuitivo y así poder dar atención a una audiencia más amplia.<br/>Para aprovechar mejor este taller, es necesario tener algo de experiencia con análisis exploratorio de datos y modelos lineales, de tal manera de poder transitar sin mucho obstáculo teórico por cada una de las etapas del modelamiento con efectos mixtos. Además, es necesario contar con conocimientos iniciales de algunos paquetes del tidyverse (como {readr} y {dplyr}).<\/p> <p>- REQUERIMIENTOS<\/p> <p>Además de {tidyverse} y {tidymodels}, que utilizamos en la primera parte de este taller, es necesario instalar los siguientes paquetes:<\/p> <p>&gt; install.packages(c(\"broom.mixed\",\"lme4\",\"lmerTest\"))<\/p> <p>Luego del taller se dejarán referencias para quienes tengan interés en una explicación más detallada sobre modelos mixtos y {tidymodels}, de tal manera que cuando comiencen a usar estas herramientas con sus propios datos dispongan de mayor información.

Thanks to cloud hosting and standardized formats, Earth observation data is getting easier to access, but it’s still hard to analyze lots of it. Dask is a logical solution to this problem. Unlike proprietary platforms, like Google Earth Engine, Dask integrates with the Python data science ecosystem—and new tools like stackstac are opening the door to connecting these enormous datasets of global change with the Python ecosystem. Moreover, with a platform like Coiled, it’s easy to scale out your code to the cloud and run it next to the data, letting you process this planet-sized data.<\/p> <p>After attending, you’ll know:<\/p> <p>– The landscape of geospatial tools in Python, and how they do and don’t fit together<br/>– The limits on Earth-scale data in Dask, and what we’re doing to expand them<br/>– [Sneak peek!] Making an interactive map that renders on-the-fly with Dask, stackstac, and Coiled (aka your own mini Earth Engine)<br/>– The one simple trick to remove all clouds from your satellite imagery that doctors DON’T want you to know!! (lol nope, sorry this doesn’t exist.)<\/p> <p>You’ll also learn:<\/p> <p>– What a STAC and COG is, why stacking your COGs is hard, and how Dask+stackstac make this easy<br/>– How to search Earth observation data in STAC catalogs<br/>– How to stack lots of GeoTIFFs into a timeseries using stackstac<br/>– Compositing, clipping, and basic analysis of raster timeseries in xarray<\/p> <p>Join us on 29th April at 11 am US Eastern time to learn about what could come next for Earth observation in Python!<\/p> <p>REGISTER HERE: <a href=\"https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_El_t3XNxSQ2HCr6zU3QzRQ\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_El_t3XNxSQ2HCr6zU3QzRQ<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Our June Meetup will be a remote gathering; the Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Infographics are everywhere, and when well-designed can be a fantastic way of sharing data highlights in an engaging and visually appealing way to non-technical audiences. Typically infographics are custom made by a graphic designer who has been provided the numbers that will be represented in the graphic, and therefore can be time-intensive to produce. Producing more than one infographic of the same design to display different values (for instance, for different geographical areas) has a linear increase in production time for each n+1 graphic once the basic design time has been accounted for. This talk will describe a novel method for producing infographics using R that allows for dynamically adjusting the graphical elements based on any number of data values and rapidly producing bespoke versions. A walkthrough of the process used to create 3,142 custom infographics (one for each county in the US) will be presented to illustrate the process.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Zadra, PhD is a Director of Data Science at the non-profit Sorenson Impact Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.

    "description": "<p>We're happy to have a wonderful speaker and topic to start our first virtual meetup. Abed W Ayyad (<a href=\"https://manipulativegerbil.blogspot.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://manipulativegerbil.blogspot.com/<\/a>) will share his exploration of solar PV and how R can be used for solar PV in Alberta.<\/p> <p>Solar energy converted to electricity (photovoltaic, or PV, electricity) seems almost too good to be true when it comes to thinking about ways of reducing global carbon emissions. According to a widely repeated claim, one hour's worth of the solar radiation which falls on the earth's surface could meet human energy needs for one year. Though impressive and technically \"correct\", this is far from being a practical or meaningful calculation. So how much carbon-neutral electricity could someone sitting in the Canadian prairies actually harvest from the sunshine falling on their backyard?<\/p> <p>R lends itself perfectly to the data intensive task of planning and predicting the amount of solar insolation which falls on a given location, and the electricity which one can expect to harvest from it. Following a (very) broad introduction to solar energy and photovoltaics, we will explore a number of packages available in R which make it possible to access and analyse publicly available data on solar insolation, and to understand what this might mean in terms of solar PV potential at a site in Alberta. We will accomplish the latter by doing a walk-through of an example using the nasapower package available in CRAN, as well as a number of the graphics and GIS-related packages also available in R. This talk, aimed at a wide audience of R users, will illustrate why Alberta is a surprisingly perfect location for solar PV deployment and how you can convince yourself of that using R.<\/p> <p>About the speaker: Abed has used R in a variety of settings for seven years now, for GIS/cartography applications, data analysis and linear optimisation. There are many reasons to love R, but the community of users is definitely one of the biggest. Last September, Edmonton became the 10th city which Abed has called home during his life. Abed is looking forward to discovering more of the city, and to cycling to some parks and lakes as the summer goes on and the days get longer.<\/p> ",

It is designed to be suitable for low-level system programming with high performance and low overhead while providing modern abstractions and protection from undefined behavior. The most common application scenarios for Rust are those that otherwise might be suitable for C or C++. As such, Rust may be a good choice for writing extensions to high-level interactive languages such as R. The extendr project was founded with the goal to make writing Rust extensions to R as easy and painless as possible. At the same time, extendr also enables the reverse use case, writing standalone Rust programs that call R code and take advantage of the R runtime. This talk will provide an overview of the extendr API and its key design choices, and it will highlight simple use cases and known pitfalls. The talk is meant primarily as an introduction to Rust for current R users. However, experienced Rust programmers who want to branch out into data science and statistical programming may also find this talk helpful.<\/p> <p>About Claus:<br/>Claus Wilke is the Jane and Roland Blumberg Centennial Professor in Molecular Evolution at The University of Texas at Austin. He holds a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Bochum in Germany, and he received postdoctoral training in biological physics in the lab of Chris Adami at Caltech.

    "description": "<p>Productivity in R often boils down to automating repetitive steps, and iterating over a structured dataset is a common task in more complex data manipulation.<\/p> <p>There are many ways to achieve this: While some feel most comfortable writing procedural for-loops, others Vectorize() their functions in order to pass them multiple values at once. Yet another camp swears by the functional style of purrr's map() and reduce() functions (the tidy alternative to the the *apply family of functions in base R). And a fourth category of useRs struggle to get their head wrapped around serializiation in the first place. (Let's just ignore the hopeless cases who write straight-up recursive functions with no concern for stack size.)<\/p> <p>It has been rumored that a more functional style makes everything faster – but is that really true? Doesn't it make the code just too hard to read? And can any loop really be replaced by a map?<\/p> <p>For our May meeting, let's challenge the functional fanboys and *girls among us. Bring a contained, reproducible example loop (side effects welcome!) and we will ask the mapheads to reformulate it as a higher order function.<\/p> <p>As always, useRs of all backgrounds and at all levels of expertise are invited to participate. Learning R is not a competition. Come join us!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hello R-Ladies!<\/p> <p>Join us on April 28th for a workshop on Tidyverse functions!<\/p> <p>Event Description: Tidyverse functions were designed for their ease of use by humans, and are best known and used in interactive R coding, or as part of a literate code document (e.g., R Markdown) or script, where they are run in the global environment (i.e., not inside a function). Here they feel easy to use and powerful, as you can access things like column names as if they were available to you as objects themselves. However, this ease of use by humans is a trade off for “more work required” when you want to start programming with these. For example, when using them inside functions. In this short workshop, we will introduce what makes programming with Tidyverse functions challenging and how we can rise up to meet these challenges.<\/p> <p>**This workshop assumes you have used 2-3 Tidyverse functions and know how to write a function in R. (See below for resources) ***<\/p> <p>About the Speaker: Dr. Tiffany Timbers is an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Statistics and a Co-Director for the Master of Data Science program (Vancouver Option) at the University of British Columbia. In these roles, she teaches and develops curriculum around the responsible application of Data Science to solve real-world problems.

Non, car vous apprendrez aussi à devenir un·e utilisateur·rice de R résilient·e !<br/>Dans cette présentation je partagerai des astuces à cet effet : comment suivre les nouveautés de R sans se sentir submergé·e ; et comment et où demander de l’aide efficacement. J’espère que chacun·e repartira avec quelques clés de plus pour une utilisation joyeuse de R !<\/p> <p>L'oratrice :<\/p> <p>Maëlle Salmon est actuellement Research Software Engineer chez rOpenSci. Mais ce n'est pas tout ! Maëlle est également très impliquée dans la communauté R puisqu'elle travaille sur beaucoup d'autres projets en tant que developpeuse et/ou formatrice en R. Pour ne citer qu'eux : elle a notamment contribué à la création du livre \"HTTP testing in R\", est à l'origine du blog R-hub et assure la gestion du compte twitter R-Ladies Global.

You can come to University of Sydney in person (location: F10A[masked].Law Annex Lecture Theatre 024). Or join via zoom.<\/p> <p>Data sometimes have artefacts which obscure the patterns we are interested in visualising. You may have come across this when trying to interpret a residual plot from a logistic regression. For discrete data, these are not really artefacts, they are properties of the distribution of the data, like mean-variance relationships and lots of zeros. Generalised linear models and their extensions model the distribution of the data, including these properties, and so are a good way to remove them, to better see the patterns we are actually interested in. I will talk though some concepts and lots of examples of how we can use models to get the best out of our visualisations of discrete multivariate data in R.<\/p> <p>Biography<br/>Gordana is a statistical consultant and research fellow at UNSW Sydney, with research interests in modelling and visualising multivariate discrete data in ecology.

In this presentation, I’ll discuss how I crafted a job interview presentation by making modifications on publicly available TidyTuesday code. This built the technical and confidence-boosting scaffolding I needed for more open-ended projects. The success of this experience inspired me to transition from my role as a consumer and creator to contributor to give back to the R community, which has been incredibly fulfilling.

The event will happen online on May 4th 2021, at 6:30 pm CET.<\/p> <p>[ABOUT THE SPEAKER]<br/>-------------------------------<br/>Alexa is a quantitative ecologist and a postdoctoral associate at Rutgers University. In her work, she uses data science, modeling, and synthetic approaches to solve interdisciplinary environmental problems. Most of her research investigates how climate change and human activities alter ecological processes, and in particular, the change in movement and spatial distribution of species in response to climate change.<\/p> <p>[TOPIC]<br/>-----------<br/>In this talk, Alexa will share a little bit about her cutting-edge research and demonstrate how she uses modelling methods in R to understand and solve interdisciplinary research questions in the field ecology and climate change. This session will consist of a presentation followed by a hands-on workshop where you'll get a chance to work in R-studio running your own analysis! We GUARANTEE that you'll learn something new and come out of this session inspired and smiling! :)<\/p> <p>[PROGRAM]<br/>-----------------<br/>18.30 - 18.35 Virtual Welcome<br/>18.35 - 18.45 Intro to R-Ladies and today's presentation<br/>18.45 - 19:45 Interactive presentation + workshop by Alexa<br/>19:45 - 20:30 Q &amp; A + end of session discussion<\/p> <p>(timeslots subject to change)<\/p> <p>[ZOOM LINK]<br/>---------------<br/>Stay tuned!

They maintain the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. They nourish other living organisms and supply psychological benefits to humans as well, improving our moods and beautifying the landscape around us. But plants don’t just passively provide. They also take action.<\/p> <p>Beronda L. Montgomery explores the vigorous, creative lives of organisms often treated as static and predictable. In fact, plants are masters of adaptation. They “know” what and who they are, and they use this knowledge to make a way in the world. Plants experience a kind of sensation that does not require eyes or ears. They distinguish kin, friend, and foe, and they are able to respond to ecological competition despite lacking the capacity of fight-or-flight. Plants are even capable of transformative behaviors that allow them to maximize their chances of survival in a dynamic and sometimes unfriendly environment.<\/p> <p>Lessons from Plants enters into the depth of botanic experience and shows how we might improve human society by better appreciating not just what plants give us but also how they achieve their own purposes. What would it mean to learn from these organisms, to become more aware of our environments and to adapt to our own worlds by calling on perception and awareness? Montgomery’s meditative study puts before us a question with the power to reframe the way we live: What would a plant do?<\/p> ",

Using the example of a working project on political party networks, I show how one can gather campaign finance data and reshape it to construct relational networks between political actors. Using tidyverse packages for management, and network analysis packages, such as statnet and igraph for visualization, I talk about how to manage, visualize, and analyze political data as relations, rather than as individuals.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennifernvictor\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/jennifernvictor<\/a><\/p> <p>Website:<\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.

The nyccensus package is a simple data-sharing package meant to ease the pains of accessing and wrangling publicly-available response rate data from the 2020 Decennial Census as well as other relevant demographic data from the American Community Survey at various geographic levels in New York City. I will share some lessons learned and examples of how these data can be used to better understand and address equity issues in NYC.<\/p> <p>Bio: Natalie O'Shea is a researcher and data visualization specialist with a passion for equity, accessibility, and human-centered design. She started her data science journey during graduate school, falling in love with all things R in her coursework and research. She was part of CUNY's first Data for Public Good cohort before taking a position as a Community Outreach Data Analyst with the NYC Census 2020 initiative and then working as a Data Visualization Specialist at NYC Test &amp; Trace Corps. She is currently working as a Data Visualization Analyst on the Research and Learning Engineering team at Edmentum.<\/p> <p>\"Creating Production Level Data Science Code\"<br/>Speaker: Megan Robertson<\/p> <p>Abstract: Writing code is a big part of working as a data scientist. You write code throughout all stages of a project from exploratory data analysis to building models. This talk focuses on creating production code from a proof of concept analysis or model. How do you organize and adapt all the code created to get to a proof of concept? Do you feel overwhelmed by everything you need to do? At the end of this talk you’ll walk away with tips and strategies to make your own production code.<\/p> <p>Bio: Megan Robertson is a Senior Data Scientist at Nike. She has multiple years of experience applying data science in retail settings. She first became interested in math and statistics through sports analytics, and wrote her Master’s thesis in collaboration with an NBA team. Her background includes training in Bayesian methodology, statistical modeling, machine learning and more. Megan has delivered multiple talks on various aspects of data science from building a career and project management to writing code. She is currently writing her first data science book, Mastering Communication in Data Science, in partnership with Manning.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.
