    "description": "<p>Writing R code that maximizes our abilities to work collaboratively<br/>Presented by Ezra Tucker<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>How best to work with other data scientists in a team to organize and structure code? S4 classes in R give structure to your data and help you organize your methods. They also help signal to your team members proper use of the data structures you define and what methods are available, in essence, how to use your code properly, and also, how to add to it or modify it later on.<\/p> <p>In this talk, we will empower ourselves by reminding ourselves that data scientists are a particular class of programmers (distinct from those who create PC/console games, those who create mobile apps, those who create websites, etc) but programmers all the same. Then we will briefly discuss the benefits of code encapsulation, especially with respect to packages and S4 classes while touching briefly on other OOP systems in R. We will discuss when and how to implement them, and how to structure your code base in a clean, effective, and consistent manner so that it's clear and easy to understand for your teammates and to yourself.<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Ezra Tucker is the Director of Data Science at Energetic Insurance<\/p> <p>Energetic Insurance is a Managing General Underwriter (MGU) with a novel, data-driven approach to develop new risk management products to unlock exponential growth in the renewable energy industry<\/p> ",

    "group": "Cleveland R User Group",
    "start": "2021-05-26",
    "description": "<p>When we make an inventory of opportunities to add value to organizations with data, often there is low hanging fruit that does not require much investment in actual data analysis, but can be solved by automating data aspects of business processes. In fact there is a whole industry around this called robotic process automation (RPA). But where RPA offers a low-code approach to setting up automation tasks, it is easy to undervalue R for setting up these tasks with R code.<\/p> <p>In this talk I would like to share some of the experiences we have had automating tasks with R. The tools we use range from great packages like fs to work with the filesystem on the R side. But there are also packages to make it easier to work with cron jobs on Linux (cronR) and the task scheduler on Windows (taskscheduleR).<\/p> <p>When you combine this with other tools of the automation trade like httr to access API's or plumber to write API's there is practically no limit to what you can achieve using only R and readily available tools on linux and windows. I hope that the talk will inspire a lively discussion where we share experiences and ideas about automating processes with R.<\/p> <p>Frans van Dunn√© (<a href=\"https://www.fransvandunne.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.fransvandunne.com/<\/a>) is Chief Data Officer at ixpantia (<a href=\"https://www.ixpantia.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ixpantia.com/<\/a>). He combines a diverse skill-set, that includes business analysis, data analysis and enterprise architecture, with more than 15 years of experience to help organizations respond to their data driven innovation needs quickly and effectively. Frans has a PhD in biology from the University of Amsterdam and has taught at universities in Europe and Latin America. As a consultant he has worked with companies around the world on diverse topics, including data driven innovation, applied statistics, statistical programming and machine learning.<\/p> <p>Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.<\/p> ",

This month, Anna Spiers will be giving us an introduction to spatial data and map-making in R!<\/p> <p>From Anna: Working with spatial data can feel as finicky as caring for your favorite houseplant - your attempts to help are rejected despite following instructions, and you look longingly at friends' and colleagues' masterpieces (i.e., maps/plants). This talk will introduce spatial data broadly, and cover some of the basic workflows and troubleshooting steps in R. Specifically, we will work with vector data, focus on the `sp` and `sf` libraries, and produce an interactive map in R. Example data and code will be provided.<\/p> <p>We will be meeting over Zoom (Meeting link visible when you RSVP). Join us to connect with other R users in the Boulder area and learn some new techniques to apply in your work!<\/p> <p>We hope you'll also join our local Slack workspace to keep the R help and conversation flowing!

Social vulnerability is defined as the resilience of communities when dealing with external stresses on health, such as age, housing, race/ethnicity, and more. For analysis, we used multiple linear regression to determine which social vulnerability variables are most directly related with hospital capacity in each county in California, using average bed utilization rate as our measure of hospital capacity. The significant predictors from our model were: the proportion of the county‚Äôs population under 17, the percentage of individuals reporting severe housing situations, the proportion of the county's population that are Black, the percentage of single parent households, and the percentage of households with more people than rooms. We then developed a county-level social vulnerability index (SVI) and concluded that there was a relationship between the SVI and COVID-19 case prevalence per county after mapping both of them using Tableau. Our findings suggest that more socially vulnerable counties are less equipped to handle impacts of COVID-19 and more resources should be allocated to them to establish equitable health outcomes. This project was originally created in May 2020, with updates to COVID case rates in December 2020.<\/p> <p># Predicting Benzodiazepines Use<br/>Speakers: Tiffany Feng, Eustina Kim, Diana Pham, Kienna Qin<br/>Seniors, Department of Statistics, UCLA<\/p> <p>Bio: Tiffany Feng, UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Digital Humanities minor; Eustina Kim: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Digital Humanities minor; Diana Pham: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Global Health minor; Kienna Qin: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major<\/p> <p>Abstract: This project explores which characteristics among students, health care professionals, and veterans determined the use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) in a sample of participants in the United States during 2018. BZDs are a type of drug that produces sedation and lowers anxiety levels. They are the most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., and, unfortunately, are frequently abused and taken with other drugs. We used multinomial logistic regression and various data visualizations to determine that having a history of drug use, mental illness, and prescriptions for opioids for treating pain are important in predicting the use of BZD for all three occupations in our sample. The largest impacts for each occupation were a history of drug use for students, mental illness and opioid prescriptions for pain for veterans, and there were similar influences for each category for health professionals. Although our data was not a representative sample, this could still demonstrate the importance of investigating the unique differences in determining BZD use for each occupation, which could lead into interventions such as targeted programs to reduce BZD misuse in each occupation. Hopefully with these insights, we can make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by the misuse of BZDs in the United States.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>En esta sesi√≥n comenzaremos a explorar c√≥mo de potentes son los m√©todos de clusterizaci√≥n para solucionar m√∫ltiples problemas y lo haremos a trav√©s de varios ejemplos.<\/p> <p>Lo aprenderemos de la mano de Elena Rivas Ruzafa (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-rivas-ruzafa/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-rivas-ruzafa/<\/a>) , Head of Engineering - Digital Products que durante la sesi√≥n nos guiar√° y aprenderemos mediante ejemplos.<\/p> <p>Dentro del machine learning, la clusterizaci√≥n se enmarca dentro del aprendizaje no supervisado, es decir, esos algoritmos para los que solo disponemos de un conjunto de datos de entrada que no est√°n etiquetados y sobre los que obtendremos informaci√≥n sin conocer de antemano cu√°l ser√° la respuesta correcta. Esta situaci√≥n se da muy a menudo y provocar√° que la forma en la que hemos de testear los resultados sea muy particular. Tambi√©n veremos que la creaci√≥n de visualizaciones de datos y la generaci√≥n de gr√°ficos, se convertir√° en una parte esencial de la exploraci√≥n de dichos resultados.<\/p> <p>Lo que obtendremos tras el proceso de clusterizaci√≥on ser√° una segmentaci√≥n de los datos en grupos similares que ser√°n lo que conocemos como ‚Äúcl√∫steres‚Äù. Aunque es un problema de clasificaci√≥n no debemos confundir clusterizaci√≥n con clasificaci√≥n. Ambos son m√©todos de identificaci√≥n de patrones, pero mientras el primero pertenece al aprendizaje no supervisado, el segundo, m√°s conocido, pertenece al aprendizaje supervisado. Tambi√©n trataremos de explicar estas diferencias.<\/p> <p>Adem√°s de resolver algunos casos pr√°cticos durante la sesi√≥n, veremos c√≥mo estos m√©todos pueden solucionar diferentes problemas en m√∫ltiples √°mbitos (en medicina para el diagn√≥stico de enfermedades, en redes sociales para encontrar grupos de comportamiento similares, en finanzas para generar estrategias dirigidas a los diferentes grupos de clientes...)<\/p> <p>Todo esto lo haremos en el entorno de programaci√≥n R en el que existen m√∫ltiples paquetes que implementan algoritmos de clustering y funciones para visualizar sus resultados. Durante la sesi√≥n trabajaremos con algunos de los m√°s interesantes.<\/p> <p>Estas son las librer√≠as que usaremos, para que vay√°is instal√°ndolas.

They maintain the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. They nourish other living organisms and supply psychological benefits to humans as well, improving our moods and beautifying the landscape around us. But plants don‚Äôt just passively provide. They also take action.<\/p> <p>Beronda L. Montgomery explores the vigorous, creative lives of organisms often treated as static and predictable. In fact, plants are masters of adaptation. They ‚Äúknow‚Äù what and who they are, and they use this knowledge to make a way in the world. Plants experience a kind of sensation that does not require eyes or ears. They distinguish kin, friend, and foe, and they are able to respond to ecological competition despite lacking the capacity of fight-or-flight. Plants are even capable of transformative behaviors that allow them to maximize their chances of survival in a dynamic and sometimes unfriendly environment.<\/p> <p>Lessons from Plants enters into the depth of botanic experience and shows how we might improve human society by better appreciating not just what plants give us but also how they achieve their own purposes. What would it mean to learn from these organisms, to become more aware of our environments and to adapt to our own worlds by calling on perception and awareness? Montgomery‚Äôs meditative study puts before us a question with the power to reframe the way we live: What would a plant do?<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>For the June 1st edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Dr. Danica Slavish as our guest speaker. Dr. Slavish will introduce the topic of Latent Profile Analyses using the tidyLPA framework.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Latent Profile Analyses using tidyLPA<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: Do adolescents who try alcohol before age 15 have worse health in adulthood than those who try alcohol later in life? Are there different subtypes of COVID-19 symptoms? How do these subtypes predict hospitalization risk? What types of advertisements most strongly predict if someone buys a product?<\/p> <p>All these questions can be answered using the statistical technique, latent profile analysis (LPA). LPA is a powerful statistical tool to identify hidden clusters in your data based on a set of variables. LPA is superior to other data reduction techniques like k-means clustering in that it generates probabilities of group membership. In this talk, a brief introduction to LPA using the R package tidyLPA will be covered. Using sample data on daily sleep patterns of nurses, we will walk through an example using the current gold standard 3-step approach: 1) estimate class membership, 2) extract class probabilities, 3) examine predictors of class membership. Best practices and advantages and disadvantages of LPA will be discussed.<\/p> <p>Bio: Dr. Danica Slavish is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of North Texas. Danica‚Äôs research focuses on how sleep problems and stressful life experiences interact to predict health outcomes across time. Her research team uses a variety of statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal data in R, including multilevel modeling, time-varying effect modeling, network analyses, and Bayesian analyses. Danica currently teaches courses in health psychology, advanced statistics, and research methods. Before joining UNT, Danica completed her Ph.D. in biobehavioral health at Penn State, where she was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. She holds an undergraduate degree in psychology from Beloit College, in Beloit, WI.<\/p> <p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danicaslavish\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/danicaslavish<\/a><\/p> <p>Website:<\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.

This is motivated by my own obsession with colors and my own experience that different plots with different audiences respond differently to different themes.<\/p> <p>Bio: Anna Sofia Kircher is the data scientist at Lendable and works with data of various fintechs in emerging and frontier markets.<\/p> <p>‚ÄúDoes your color palette match your data?‚Äù<br/>Speaker: Joyce Robbins<\/p> <p>Abstract: One of the most common graphical mistakes is choosing an inappropriate color scheme for your data. In this talk, I‚Äôll explain how sequential, diverging and qualitative color schemes are each suited to a different type of data. We‚Äôll then look at a variety of plots that could be improved with alternative color choices. My hope is that these examples will serve as conversation starters for a lively discussion on matching color to data.<\/p> <p>Bio: Joyce Robbins (@jtrnyc) is a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. She specializes in data visualization and statistical literacy.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

The model consists of two parts:<br/>A model for the election outcome (i.e. the vote share for each party based on poll data) and a model to assign a probability to the coalition of the actual government using expert survey data. An in-depth description and motivation is discussed in this talk. The model is fitted with (R)Stan, a Bayesian modeling framework, that can seamlessly be integrated into R.<\/p> <p># Agenda<br/>18:30 Intro<br/>18:35 Talk<br/>19:05 Q&amp;A<br/>19:30 Closing remarks (we can extend it if needed)<\/p> <p># Bios<br/>Marcus Gro√ü and Michelle Golchert are Data Scientists at INWT Statistics.<br/>Marcus holds a Ph.D. in Statistics and has several years experience consulting on and managing projects in the data science field.

UI plays a huge role in the success of Shiny projects. shiny.fluent enables you to build Shiny apps in a novel way using Microsoft‚Äôs Fluent UI as the UI foundation. It gives your app a beautiful, professional look and a rich set of components while retaining the speed of development that Shiny is famous for.<\/p> <p>Fluent UI is based on the Javascript library React, so it‚Äôs a challenging task to make it work with Shiny. We have put the parts responsible for making this possible in a separate package called shiny.react, which enables you to port other React-based components and UI libraries so that they work in Shiny.<\/p> <p>During the talk we will demonstrate how to use shiny.fluent to build your own Shiny apps, and explain how we solved the main challenges in integrating React and Shiny<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Kamil is a Full Stack Engineer at Appsilon. He graduated with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Warsaw. He is passionate about working across various technologies, leading projects, and developing internal tooling.

    "description": "<p>This meetup we'll have two shorter talks by Jai Ranchod and Bryan Lewis. Details below.<\/p> <p>Talk 1: Jai Ranchod - Extract tabular data from PDFs with pdftools<\/p> <p>I'm going to be talking about how to pull tabular data out of a PDF based on partial string matching and some functions in the \"PDF Tools\" package. The need to do this presented itself when the president of the management company wanted a table of information for the 60+ properties in our portfolio and our software vendor said they could only give us PDFs of word docs.<\/p> <p>Jai (\"Jay\") Ranchod is currently an Operations and Financial Analyst are Rose Community Management, a property management firm based in NYC with offices in Independence, OH. I started using R at my previous job at Epic Systems which is an electronic healthcare record company as part of the quality control process on their cognitive computing products. Since then I have taken several online classes in R, data science, and machine learning including a professional certificate program in data science taught using R. I have a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Wooster and recently finished my MBA from John Carroll University.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Bryan Lewis - R and DuckDB<\/p> <p>DuckDB (<a href=\"https://duckdb.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://duckdb.org<\/a>) is a new embedded SQL database library in the spirit of other embedded databases like SQLite. Unlike SQLite, DuckDB uses a column-oriented data layout (like R data frames) and has a particular focus on performance for interactive data analysis. DuckDB's integration with R is so complete that it can work directly on in-memory language objects without copying. This lets you use DuckDB directly on R data frames, including excellent support for dplyr.<\/p> <p>I'll show some practical examples of R and DuckDB and share my thoughts how to best use these technologies together.<\/p> <p>Bryan Lewis is a mathematician, author of the irlba and threejs R packages, and coauthor of the recent CRC textbook \"A Computational Approach to Statistical Learning.\" He previously worked on Mike Stonebraker's open-source SciDB array database project.<\/p> <p>Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Our August Meetup will be a remote gathering; the Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Infographics are everywhere, and when well-designed can be a fantastic way of sharing data highlights in an engaging and visually appealing way to non-technical audiences. Typically infographics are custom made by a graphic designer who has been provided the numbers that will be represented in the graphic, and therefore can be time-intensive to produce. Producing more than one infographic of the same design to display different values (for instance, for different geographical areas) has a linear increase in production time for each n+1 graphic once the basic design time has been accounted for. This talk will describe a novel method for producing infographics using R that allows for dynamically adjusting the graphical elements based on any number of data values and rapidly producing bespoke versions. A walkthrough of the process used to create 3,142 custom infographics (one for each county in the US) will be presented to illustrate the process.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Zadra, PhD is a Director of Data Science at the non-profit Sorenson Impact Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. He combines his skills in statistics, programming, and data visualization with expertise in data privacy and policy to empower governments, nonprofits, and philanthropists working in a wide array of issue areas. His areas of focus include criminal justice data (including work with the PEW Charitable Trusts, Utah Department of Corrections, Utah Indigent Defense Commission, and Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice), early- and higher-education data including a multi-year project supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as other issue areas like homelessness or poverty, and has worked on many smaller projects building evaluations and impact measurements for a variety of social-good non-profits around the country. He received his doctorate from the University of Virginia, where he studied cognitive science and neuroscience and designed and conducted rigorous RCTs - and also fell in love with R way back in 2006!<\/p> ",

Hier ist ihre Vortragsank√ºndigung:<\/p> <p>Combining Prediction and Interpretation in Decision Trees (PrInDT): modeling linguistic variation in R<br/>In this presentation, we show that conditional inference trees and ensembles are suitable methods for modeling linguistic variation. As against earlier linguistic applications, however, we claim that their suitability is strongly increased if we combine prediction and interpretation. To that end, we have developed a statistical method in R, PrInDT (Prediction and Interpretation with Decision Trees), which we introduce and discuss in our presentation.<\/p> <p>* Es handelt sich um einen englischsprachigen Vortrag.<br/>* Es ist ein 30-min√ºtiger Vortrag<\/p> <p>Wir freuen uns schon darauf euch auch bei diesem Meetup begr√º√üen zu d√ºrfen.

    "description": "<p>Text is one of the most prominent and extensive data sources in the digital world. It can be an insight into consumer opinions, social media trends, and literary story arches. However, it can be difficult to analyze without specialized tools and commands. The tidytext package and framework makes it easy to go from full text files to clean data and ultimately, analysis!<\/p> <p>The workshop will start with the building blocks of text analysis: separating a text into smaller chunks, removing punctuation, and identifying frequent words or phrases. If you‚Äôve joined our previous text analysis meetups before, this will be a great recap; if you haven‚Äôt, this will bring you right up to speed! We‚Äôll show you all you need to know so beginners to the topic are very much welcome.<\/p> <p>The focus for the evening will be on going beyond individual words in isolation to n-grams: units of a set number of words (e.g. bigrams like ‚ÄúI think‚Äù, ‚Äúthink that‚Äù, ‚Äúthat tidytext‚Äù, ‚Äútidytext is‚Äù, ‚Äúis great‚Äù.). This will allow us to get a sense of context about words based on the company they keep and address typical text analysis problems (e.g. \"happy\" preceded by \"not\" being given a positive sentiment score).<\/p> <p>We‚Äôll top it all off with some truly unique visualizations that show the relationship between words, like bigram network plots with ggraph. Materials will be based on the book Tidy Text Mining by Julia Silge and David Robinson (chapter 4).<\/p> ",

Isn‚Äôt the statement that R is ‚Äòjust a research-only language mainly used by academia‚Äô outdated?<\/p> <p>Spoiler alert: you definitely can use R in production. From ETL to (Shiny) web applications to machine learning models: some of the main business processes at Analytic Health are powered by R. During this talk, Veerle will dive into what ‚Äúproduction‚Äù means and how you can use R in a context outside of academia. By showing how R is being used at Analytic Health and how processes and applications are deployed and managed we hope to show you that R can do more than statistics only.

But with that flexibility, comes a<br/>high learning curve. In this workshop, I will be teaching 3 basic<br/>concepts to create any chart with D3. These concepts are SVGs, data<br/>binding, and scales. When you understand these fundamentals you will<br/>be able to use your d3 scripts with your R shiny apps through the r2d3<br/>R package.<\/p> <p>I‚Äôm excited to teach you about the foundations of working with D3.js.<\/p> ",
