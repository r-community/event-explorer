At its heart is `map()` and friends: functions for the common pattern of iterating over a vector or list, doing something to each element, and then storing the results. These functions let you iterate efficiently and with less code. As Jenny Bryan once said, “of course someone needs to write `for` loops; it doesn’t have to be you.”<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>**Schedule**<br/>6:00-6:45 open door<br/>6:45-7:30 talk starts (45min presentation + Q&amp;A)<br/>7:30-8:00 socialize<br/>8:00 leave venue<\/p> <p>**Venue**<br/>Address: WeWork One Culver, 10000 Washington Boulevard, Culver City, CA 90232<\/p> <p>Thanks to our sponsor Sabio Mobile (<a href=\"https://sabiomobile.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://sabiomobile.com<\/a>), food and drinks will be provided at the event.

Tools for building a CNN are R and TensorFlow. The implementation of CNN in R will be demonstrated.<\/p> <p>Luke will talk about using C++ in R. Are is a beautiful language but some operations can be slow. The RCpp package makes this an easy talk and can drastically improve the performance of your code.<\/p> <p>Come early, network, enjoy the food and talks.<\/p> <p># Schedule<br/>6:30 - 6:50 Networking<br/>6:50 - 7:00 Welcome &amp; general announcement<br/>7:00 - 7:30 Convolutional Neural Networks<br/>7:30 - 8:00 Speeding up R with Rcpp<br/>8:00 - Raffle<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Networking and Clean-up<\/p> <p># Talk 1<\/p> <p>## Title: Convolutional Neural Networks<br/>## Speaker: Ash Pahwa<br/>## Abstract<br/>A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks used primarily for analyzing visual imagery. CNNs are used for object recognition in an image. Autonomous cars use CNN technology to navigate smoothly on the roads. There are many biomedical applications where CNN is used for image analysis.<\/p> <p>The motivation for CNN originated from the Hubel &amp; Wiesel (Noble prize winners 1981) study of the human visual system. This research leads to the idea that if we apply the convolution operations to the image and then feed them to neural networks, the accuracy of object identification increases. This idea started the revolution of CNN.<\/p> <p>This talk will cover the architecture of CNN. The Convolution and Pooling operations will be covered. Tools for building a CNN are R and TensorFlow. The implementation of CNN in R will be demonstrated.<\/p> <p># Talk 2<\/p> <p>## Title: Speeding up R with Rcpp<br/>## Speaker: Luke Klein<br/>## Abstract<br/>R is a beautiful and flexible language, and it is improving all the time. However, some processes (e.g. repeated function calls) can add a lot of computational overhead. Rcpp is a package for extending R with C++ functions which is utilized by over 1000 packages on CRAN. Many R data types and objects can be mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both writing new code for people just learning C++, as well as easier integration of third-party libraries. In this talk, I'll demonstrate how easy it is to get started with Rcpp and what kind of performance boosts one can achieve. If you're taking aim at levelling-up your function writing skills then Rcpp is the place to start.<\/p> <p># Sponsor<\/p> <p>Kforce is an international staffing firm specialized in the IT and Finance and Accounting space.

The models will be limited to: linear regression, Box-Cox transformation, gamma regression, ordinary logistic regression, Poisson regression, beta regression, longitudinal (repeated measures) regression, and hierarchical model.<\/p> <p>The workshop is designed to be hands-on. Participants are required to bring laptops and be ready to write R, analyzing data and interpreting results. For each model, we present an example with a complete R code, and then will an exercise to work on. Workshop participants should be familiar with algebraic expressions of different probability distributions and have a fundamental knowledge of simple linear regression: normally distributed random error, continuous and categorical independent variables (requiring creating dummy variables).<\/p> <p>The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book “Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications”, CRC Press, 2018.<\/p> ",

In this talk we'll look at using SparkR to spread our data and data transformations over a cluster of machines.<\/p> <p>Kristen Osborne<br/>Putting R in the internet tubes; An introduction to blogdown! Blogdown is an R package that lets you create websites from R Markdown documents, making it easy to put your R code and outputs online. It creates a static website you can host on any server with minimal effort. In this talk we'll cover what blogdown is and why you might want to use it, look at some easy ways to get started, and share resources to take you further.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Carroll<br/>Got lots of loops or repetitive calculating to do? In this talk I'll walk through the basics of synchronous vs asynchronous processing and demonstrate some ways to perform calculations in parallel (or offsite) based on the {future} package.<\/p> <p>This R meet-up is governed by the R Community Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://wiki.r-consortium.org/view/R_Consortium_and_the_R_Community_Code_of_Conduct<\/a><\/p> ",

It is a great opportunity to hear more about what they are working on and network among the SoCal R Users groups, including SB R-Ladies.<\/p> <p>Malcom is a Ph.D. student in Epidemiology at USC (@malco_barrett).<\/p> <p>Title: The YAML problem: Writing and working with YAML with ymlthis<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>R Markdown is an easy-to-learn tool for reproducible research. Many people, however, bump into problems using YAML, the language that specifies metadata for R Markdown documents. ymlthis makes it easy to write valid YAML by handling the syntax and documenting the majority of YAML fields in one place. ymlthis will help you write metadata for R Markdown, bookdown, blogdown, and more. Let the Shiny add-in create a new R Markdown file for you or work with YAML and R Markdown files directly. ymlthis finally gives you a workflow that is better than trying to find and paste the YAML from the last R Markdown document you used.<\/p> <p>Zhi is a Ph.D. student in biostatistics at USC.<\/p> <p>Title: How R Markdown family automates the last mile of analytics<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>What is \"the last mile\" of analytics? It's the final step that one needs to take to deliver the insights of data and communicate results with decision-makers. R has made it easy for us to wrangle data and build models. With the power of the R Markdown family packages, your analysis can be easily turned into high-quality reproducible documents including reports, presentations, posters, webpages, and dashboards. It requires less time and efforts to create and maintain code, data, output, text in one single document, which leaves you more time working on your code.<\/p> <p>Sell you all there!<\/p> <p>Julien<\/p> ",

We will review several techniques in R to automate tasks and produce colorful, engaging insights from the data you already have in Excel or business databases. This talk will be approachable for beginners and interesting for advanced R users as well. The code demonstrated will be shared via GitHub, and the packages we will review included aws, comprehend (NLP), pdftools &amp; officer (text scraping), dplyr &amp; ggplot, visNetwork (directed graphs), mongolite (MongoDB in the cloud), and Shiny.<\/p> <p>Andy will start his presentation at about 6:00.

In the end, we get a package that can easily be applied to functional data and elsewhere.

The project is deployed with Docker and Shiny Proxy.<br/>The resulting tool enables an efficient collection and observation of relevant projects, automates parsing of target web sites to a high degree and builds up an aggregated and chronological database of newly available condominiums and rental flats.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Statisticians are typically not Software Engineers, nor are they taught good practices of software engineering. And yet, Statisticians often take the role of Software Engineers when they program functions in R.<\/p> <p>This talk covers major computer programming principles and good practices that help to make R functions intuitive to other R users and our future selves.<\/p> <p>As Statisticians try a function from any R package, they face two gaps: first, they try to figure out how to use the function; and second, they try to understand whether their actions with the function get them to their goal.<\/p> <p>The role of R programmers is to help Statisticians bridge these two gaps. For example, the second gap is small when the function provides informative feedback about its failure, execution or success. This feedback should be easy to interpret and should match the way the Statisticians think about the function.<\/p> <p>The takeaway of the talk is actionable principles which can be applied to the design of R functions.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<\/p> <p>Harel Lustiger is a Data Scientist at Harmonic Analytics Ltd. specialising in Machine Learning Architecture. His work includes building Machine Learning systems for New Zealand’s largest utility companies and public sector organisations. Harel started his career as an Electronics Engineer and after having a change of heart, moved into Statistics where he worked in Academic research for three years.

    "description": "<p>We look forward to seeing you at our next R meetup, on 9th of October.<br/>Arrive from 5:45 pm for a 6 pm talk.<\/p> <p>Synopsis:<\/p> <p>Deep learning algorithms have proven to be quite useful in various applications of machine learning, notably in image and video processing.<br/>However, these methods present some limitations. For instance, one of the main challenges in computer vision is the amount of data being processed: one image is represented as matrix with millions of entries, and a video is just multiple images stacked together. Another challenge with video processing is the presence of noise<br/>While ongoing research addresses these drawbacks, alternative methods can be explored. One of them is the concept of tensor decomposition which is particularly powerful in a high dimensional data context and can provide useful pre-processing stage before applying any deep learning model.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<\/p> <p>Rene Essomba is an Analytics manager at TAL Australia, one of the largest life insurance in Australia. As a member of the Member Analytics and Research team, his role is to help with the implementation of advanced analytics solutions to support the members of TAL's Group insurance partners. He is also a part-time student with Georgia Institute of Technology doing the online masters in computational data analytics.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Two separate topics for this meetup;<br/>Exploring Longitudinal data with the brolgar package<br/>Productionising models in AWS using SageMaker<\/p> <p>Thanks again to Servian for venue and catering!<\/p> <p>Rough agenda:<br/>5:45: Networking, food &amp; drinks<br/>6:15 First presentation<br/>7:00 Second presentation<br/>7:45 More networking<br/>8:30 Close<\/p> <p>First presentation: Making better spaghetti (plots): Exploring the individuals in longitudinal data with the brolgar package<\/p> <p>Longitudinal (panel) data provide the opportunity to examine temporal patterns of individuals, because measurements are collected on the same person at different, and often irregular, time points. The data is typically visualised using a \"spaghetti plot\", where a line plot is drawn for each individual. When overlaid in one plot, it can have the appearance of a bowl of spaghetti. With even a small number of subjects, these plots are too overloaded to be read easily. The interesting aspects of individual differences are lost in the noise.<\/p> <p>Longitudinal data is often modeled with a hierarchical linear model to capture the overall trends, and variation among individuals, while accounting for various levels of dependence. However, these models can be difficult to fit, and can miss unusual individual patterns. Better visual tools can help to diagnose longitudinal models, and better capture the individual experiences.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Nick will introduce the R package, **brolgar** (BRowse over Longitudinal data Graphically and Analytically in R), which provides tools to identify and summarise interesting individual patterns in longitudinal data.<\/p> <p>Dr. Nick Tierney completed his PhD in Statistics at QUT and is now a Lecturer at Monash University. Nick's research aims to improve data analysis workflow. This includes statistical modelling, calculating diagnostics, drawing inferences and making decisions. Crucial to this work is producing high quality software to accompany each research idea. His work so far has focussed on the importance of knowing your data ( in the R package, visdat ), and on creating principles and tools that make it easier to work with, explore, and model missing data (in the R package, naniar). Nick has also created an optimisation model that identifies and possibly relocates facilities to maximise their coverage on a population, in the R package maxcovr. Nick loves the R programming language and how it has transformed his world. He is a proud member of the rOpenSci community, a collective that works to make science open using R, and co-host a podcast with Dr. Saskia Freytag about everything #rstats named “Credibly Curious”.<\/p> <p>Second presentation: Building Scalable Production-Ready R model using AWS<\/p> <p>In this growing world of Machine Learning, we often roam around creating POCs (proof-of-concepts), but an important aspect that is often forgotten is how we bring models from POC and into production. The thing is, productionising your model and ensuring scalability is not as easy as a click of a button or minor code change. Even after you get your model into production, we must re-evaluate our model, perform A/B testing and redeploy our model. This is all part of the data science pipeline. All of these steps are time-consuming and require many configurational changes.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, Jeno will present how everyday data scientists can take the model they have built-in R, productionise it with the use of Docker and AWS SageMaker at ease. This will cover the training, deployment, A/B testing of the model you have built using R and some aspects of AWS and Docker.<\/p> <p>As a Consultant at Servian, Jeno has been helping various businesses build scalable data and cloud solutions in the areas of AI/ML, Data Warehousing, Data Migration, Serverless, and Containers. He holds a Master of Data Science degree from Monash University and is a lover for R. When he is not busy roaming around Medium on the latest tech and analysing and modeling in R, he competes in Hackathons and Datathons around Melbourne.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Three speakers are contributing to our meeting on September. The door is opening from 5:30 pm with pizza and soda for networking. A meeting starts from 6:00 pm. The following is a summary of three talks (due to the limit of words). A full abstract is noted on the page at \"<a href=\"https://imstatsbee.github.io/calgaryr/meetings1920.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://imstatsbee.github.io/calgaryr/meetings1920.html<\/a>\"<\/p> <p>1. Burning out of Time: Power-Plant Decommissions and Mine Cloures in the Appalachians, by Reinaldo Viccini<\/p> <p>He investigates the claim that power plant decommissions are causing closures and production declines in Appalachian mines. He tested the assumption that power plants buy local coal and argues that observed differences in power plant efficiencies. He then estimates the correlations between aggregate electricity generation and coal consumption from nearby power plants on the mine’s production (intensive margin) and probability of closure (extensive margin). Finally, he estimates the causal effect of a decommission within the 10 nearest plants to the mine using an event-study method.<\/p> <p>2. Using unsupervised machine learning to tag oil and gas pressure drop methods used in commercial flow simulators, by Pablo Adames<\/p> <p>Oil and gas engineers rely on flow simulators to design and troubleshoot pipelines, wells, and thus the facilities needed to achieve production and operation targets within the safety and economic constraints. Commercial software simulators offer a wide choice of calculation methods for the pressure drop and liquid holdup at every point of the system, these are usually referred to as flow correlations for historical reasons. The difference in the numerical results of the simulations can vary significantly as a function of the flow method selected, leaving everything else constant. In his study, Schlumberger’s PIPESIM was used to assess 35 different methods on a model built from field data in the public domain, a metric was defined to assess similarity using unsupervised method. The machine learning results were compared to the empirical knowledge, and consistent results were identified for this specific production scenario.<\/p> <p>3. Asset Failure Susceptibility Ranking, using LambdaMART, by Busayo Akinloye<\/p> <p>The electric distribution system is one of the most diverse systems in the electrical grid. It consists of both overhead and underground assets. Growing power quality and reliability expectations from regulatory authorities and customers demand minimal downtime of equipment. Metrics such as System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) are closely being monitored by electric utilities and form a major part of the business’ performance indices. These growing expectations, coupled with aging assets and budget constraints require innovative and cost-effective ways to realize actionable intelligence in order to optimize spending, while improving or maintaining the quality and reliability of the electric grid. Data analysis offers a unique solution that is reproducible across all asset infrastructure of an electric grid. It employs complex machine learning and statistical algorithms to extract actionable insights and learnings from historical data. These insights will help utilities better allocate both financial and human resources to the most failure susceptible assets, truly making data-driven decisions. I will discuss the development of an asset failure susceptibility ranking system on the Calgary area Underground Residential Distribution (URD) System. This system employs the supervised ranking system used by information retrieval systems. The framework of this ranking system can be applied to all distribution system assets (equipment), due to the reproducible nature of the statistical algorithms it employs.<\/p> <p>This event is supported by PIMS and Cenvous.<\/p> ",

Erin nos dará una charla sobre Scalable Automatic Machine Learning con H2O (en inglés). ¿De qué se trata esto?<\/p> <p>* H2O es una plataforma distribuida de aprendizaje automático de código abierto diseñada para big data. Los algoritmos principales de aprendizaje automático de H2O se implementan en Java de alto rendimiento, sin embargo, las API con todas las funciones están disponibles en R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, y también a través de una interfaz web. Dado que las implementaciones de algoritmos de H2O se distribuyen, esto permite que el software escale a conjuntos de datos muy grandes -que superan la RAM en una sola máquina-. H2O actualmente presenta implementaciones distribuidas de modelos lineales generalizados, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, Stacked Ensembles (aka \"Super Learners\"), métodos de reducción de dimensionalidad (PCA, GLRM), clusterización (K-means), detección de anomalías, etc.<\/p> <p>* H2O AutoML proporciona una interfaz fácil de usar que automatiza el pre-procesamiento de datos, el entrenamiento y el ajuste de una gran selección de modelos candidatos (incluidos múltiples modelos de conjuntos apilados para un rendimiento superior) y, debido a la naturaleza distribuida de la plataforma de H2O, H2O AutoML puede escalar a conjuntos de datos muy grandes. El resultado de la ejecución de H2O AutoML es una \"tabla de clasificación\" de modelos fácilmente exportable para su uso en producción. Ejemplos de código en R y en Python estarán disponibles en GitHub para que les participantes puedan seguirlos en sus laptops (de todos modos, no es necesario que traigas tu laptop!).<\/p> <p>A lo largo de la charla, entonces, contarás con una breve descripción del campo del aprendizaje automático, seguida de una mirada detallada dentro del algoritmo AutoML de H2O.<\/p> <p>¿Te parece que este meetup no es para vos? Creemos que es una oportunidad única para conocer e interactuar con una de las mejores investigadoras de su disciplina en un ambiente relajado, amigable e inclusivo.<\/p> <p>¿El inglés te saca las ganas? Si querés hacerle alguna pregunta a Erin las organizadoras podemos ayudar.<\/p> <p>¡Ojalá te sumes! Además de la charla de Erin, vas a podér conocer más sobre R-Ladies y WiMLDS. También habrá tiempo para hacer sociales y nuevas conexiones.<\/p> <p>Nuestro compromiso: te vas a sentir muy bien y le vamos a poner la buena onda de siempre.<\/p> <p>En esta ocasión nos recibe generosamente Telecom quien también nos ofrecerá un rico catering acorde con esta ocasión tan especial.<\/p> <p>¡Nos vemos!<\/p> ",

Food and drinks afterwards.<\/p> <p>Presentations<\/p> <p>1) Hayley Tumas - Genetics the “R”ight way<br/>Decades of habitat destruction, increasing species extinction rate, and climate change have motivated ecosystem restoration efforts on a global scale. Genetic diversity is key for creating healthy and resilient populations, meaning genetic analyses are critical for informing effective ecosystem restoration. The size of genetic data, especially with recent advances, and complexity of analyses requires specialized software. In the past, analyses have required multiple software programs with different user interfaces and data formats. R has not only made genetic analyses more streamlined and straight forward, but has also increased reproducibility and provided the opportunity for more innovative approaches. From data management to data visualization and publication, R is the future for genetic analysis in conservation sciences and across other disciplines.<\/p> <p>2) David Selby - Modelling research funding with R<\/p> <p>The location of the meetup is room MUIR-112, Muirhead Tower, University of Birmingham campus (B15 2TN). The building is just off Pritchatts Road, which is a short walk from the train station (called University) or bus stop (busses X20/21/22, stop University North Gate). If you're coming by car the nearest car park is the UoB North East car park.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>**Note: This is one of two events happening this month for our Northside-Southside double header, one in Hyde Park on 9/24, and another in Evanston on 9/26. Choose one or attend both!**<\/p> <p>Dr. Leah Welty will present: \"Collaborative Reproducibility: Connecting R/R Markdown and Microsoft Word using StatTag\"<\/p> <p>Although R Markdown can render documents to Microsoft Word, R/R Markdown users must sometimes transcribe statistical content in to separate Microsoft Word documents (e.g., documents drafted by colleagues in Word, or documents that must be prepared in Word), a process that is error prone, irreproducible, and inefficient. We will present StatTag (www.stattag.org), an open source, free, and user-friendly program we developed to address this problem. StatTag establishes a bi-directional link between R/RMarkdown files and a Word document, and supports a reproducible pipeline even when: (1) statistical results must be included and updated in Word documents that were never generated from Markdown; and (2) text in Word files generated from R/RMarkdown has departed substantially from original Markdown content, for example through tracked changes or comments. We will demonstrate how to use StatTag to connect R/RMarkdown and Word files so that all files can be edited separately, but statistical content –values, tables, figures, and verbatim output– can be updated automatically in Word. Using practical examples, we will also illustrate how to use StatTag to view, edit, and rerun R/RMarkdown code directly from Word. The talk will also include an overview of reproducible research in the collaborative research.<\/p> <p>About the Speaker<br/>Leah J. Welty, PhD is Professor in the Division of Biostatistics, Department of Preventive Medicine and in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and is the Director of the Biostatistics Collaboration Center within the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. She is also the Immediate Past President of the Association of Clinical and Translational Statisticians. She earned her PhD in statistics from the University of Chicago, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research interests include longitudinal and multilevel models, psychiatric epidemiology, and the development of reproducible research tools for clinical and translational science. She is the lead biostatistician for the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a large-scale longitudinal study of psychiatric disorders and risky behaviors in delinquent youth. She has led the development of StatTag, a free, open-source program to support reproducible research in clinical and translational science.<\/p> <p>Schedule<br/>4:30-5pm - Food, Intros &amp; Announcements<br/>5-6pm - StatTag<br/>6-6:30pm - Socializing/Networking<\/p> <p>**This event is child-friendly!<br/>We realize this is an earlier start time than our normal events and strive to make it accessible to all.

There will be light snacks.<\/p> <p>The talk will be held in room 409 in the Stewart Building (149 College). Entry will be through the door on the west side of the building. Entrances to the building and room are wheelchair accessible.<\/p> <p>Talk:<br/>Transcending its origins as a programming language for statistics, R provides excellent tools for working with text. This tidyverse-based talk will provide an overview of some of the fantastic packages available for this, including (but not limited to) `stringr`, `RVerbalExpressions`, `tidytext` and `wordcloud`.<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Ella is a PhD student in Statisitcs at the University of Warwick. She followed her undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Philosophy with Masters degrees in History and Philosophy of Science and then Mathematics Education. Her interest in statistics was first piqued as a secondary school maths teacher when thinking about how to make the subject interesting for teenagers. An MSc in Applied Statistics followed (via a couple of years in working in market research), which lead to the PhD. Ella is an R enthusiast and package author, and the co-organiser of the Oxford R User Group.

Milanovića, dugogodišnjim korisnikom R-a i Data Scientis-om ogromnog znanja i iskustva koje će nesebično podeliti sa nama.<\/p> <p>Ako niste videle R-u akciji u pravom smislu te reči, dodjite da se priključite Goranovom izlaganju i kasnijoj diskusiji.<\/p> <p>S nestrpljenjem očekujemo naše okupljanje 🤗<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>R u analitici semantičkog veba: slučaj Wikidata<\/p> <p>Tokom meetup-a ću predstaviti bazu znanja, semantički veb sistem Wikidata, koji pruža podršku za struktuirane podatke slobodnoj enciklopediji Wikipedia i drugim projektima Wikimedia fondacije. Pokazaću nekoliko načina za pristup podacima sa Wikidata iz programskog jezika R, uključujući i lako upotrebljiv paket {WikidataR}. Predstaviću nekoliko Big Data analitičkih sistema razvijenih u R koji kroz mašinsko učenje (topic models - LDA, t-SNE) i vizuelizacije podataka i rezultata (rBokeh, plotly, visNetwork, igraph, dygraphs, Shiny) omogućavaju praćenje semantičke strukture Wikidata. Trudiću se, ipak, da centralna nit mog izlaganja ne bude samo prezentacija različitih sistema i rešenja, već suočavanje sa praktičnim, realnim problemima u Big Data analizama, od kojih - daću primere - neke efikasnije rešavamo u R (sa dovoljno dobrom hardverskom podrškom, naravno) nego u specijalizovanim Big Data sistemima (poput Spark, koji koristim praktično samo u ETL fazama). Voleo bih da vam poklonim neke trikove u izračunavanju ogromnih kontingencijskih tabela i metrika u R koji vam mogu poslužiti za razvoj igračaka poput popularnih recommender systems. Konačno, ako mi vreme dopusti, osvrnuo bih se na tipično savremeno obrazovanje u R za Data Science i zašto smatram da na kraju dana bolje pliva onaj koji je prvo zaista postao R programer, a onda naučio {tidyverse} - koji veoma volim i koristim svakodnevno. Biće i Rmarkdown notebook za sve koji bi voleli da počnu da uče o pristupu Wikidata iz R. Na kraju, cilj mi je da vam pokažem koliko je svet koji nastanjujemo u Data Science izuzetno zabavan, interesantan i dubok, i zašto ne treba da odustanete od namere da se u njemu profesionalno nastanite!<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Dr Goran S. Milovanović je studirao matematiku, filozofiju, i psihologiju, na Univerzitetu u Beogradu i NYU (SAD), i stekao formalno obrazovanje u eksperimentalnoj i teorijskoj psihologiji u oblasti kognitivnih nauka. Programer je od 80-ih godina i 8-bitnih mašina sa 64K RAM memorije. Njegov put u Data Science započeo je proučavanjem probabilističkih modela ljudskih kognitivnih funkcija (kategorizacija i učenje koncepata, semantička memorija, kauzalna indukcija, odlučivanje u uslovima rizika i neizvesnosti) i modeliranjem podataka dobijenih bihejvioralnim eksperimenatima. Danas radi u programskim jezicima R i Python, uz podršku raznih drugih tehnologija i standarda (Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, SPARQL, SQL, XML, JSON i drugih). Programski jezik R je njegova pasija i specijalnost. Od 2017. radi kao Data Scientist za projekte Wikidata i Wiktionary sa Wikimedia Deutschland, gde koristi R u analizi nekih od najvećih i najsloženijih skupova otvorenih podataka danas uopšte dostupnih. Vlasnik je konsultantske firme DataKolektiv.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Feel the cool breeze of Autumn R Ladies. Come and meet us because we have two speakers excited to share their research about the application of Big Data and Machine Learning in their respective field.<\/p> <p>Our first speaker is Joji Teves, a current Ph.D. fellow at the University of Copenhagen – iMED program. As a trained cellular biologist in a computational biology group, Joji is currently exploring big data tools to map out genomic marks of healthy and diseased cell states. Prior to moving to Copenhagen, Joji earned her Master’s at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, USA where she studied Patient-derived biospecimens from Parkinson’s disease patients and studied cellular marks related to cellular autophagy and UV damage in comparison to healthy age-match cohorts. As a “data science” noob, she takes on a different perspective on how data science tools can be applied in biology to study health and diseases.<\/p> <p>Our second speaker is Jhaz Petersen - a data-savvy Marketer who is a Graduate from Copenhagen Business School. She studied the traditional research methodologies but wanted to challenge that with the current technologies available. Therefore, she applies Machine Learning Algorithms in analyzing Big Data to solve Sales and Marketing case problems. She would like to share her original framework on how businesses in every industry can leverage their existing big data to create a business strategy.<\/p> <p>Program:<br/>17:00 - 17:15 Welcome<br/>17:15 - 17:35 Presentation by Joji Marie Teves - \"Exploring Computational<br/>Biology to study Cellular Health and Disease\"<br/>17:35 - 17:45 BREAK<br/>17:45 - 18:05 Presentation by Jhaz Petersen - \"Leveraging Big Data and Machine Learning in Sales &amp; Marketing - Application of Market Basket Analysis, Clustering &amp; 3D Customer Segmentation in R\"<br/>18:05 - 18:30 Closing and Networking<\/p> <p>Coffee and snacks will be served.<\/p> <p>Stay tuned for more details.<\/p> <p>*New info: If you are interested to learn the codes, I can share it after the presentation.

    "group": "R-Ladies Melbourne",

    "description": "<p>Hi Everyone! Here is the first of our two events in September!<\/p> <p>Our speaker will be Saras Windecker, who will tell us about reproducibility and containerisation in R.<\/p> <p>Research using R underpins a wide array of applied decision-making. Growing recognition of irreproducibility of results produced using R raises concerns about the credibility of research and the reliability of decisions they inform. Although there are many aspects to reproducible research, one major problem is the basic lack of computational reproducibility of published work – or the ability to rerun an analysis and reproduce the same results. There are many strategies for improving computational reproducibility, such as clear code structure, functional programming, and version control. Besides these tactics, however, we often find that analyses that reproduce on one machine or in one environment do not run in another, or do not run in the future. This problem is related to changing computing environments and software versions, and can be addressed using containerisation. In this talk, I will introduce containerisation and its implementation using an open-access R package. This introduction should be accessible to those who have never heard of or used containerisation before, as well as those who already actively use services such as Docker for containerisation.<\/p> <p>Saras Windecker is a Research Fellow in Ecological Modeling at the School of BioSciences, University of Melbourne. She is currently working on spatial risk modelling for Buruli ulcer in Victoria, and is more broadly interested in applied Bayesian hierarchical models, forecasting, and open science.<\/p> <p>Saras' talk will be hosted by our fantastic sponsor Zendesk. Pizza and drinks will be provided for the evening. Please arrive any time from 5:30pm for a 6pm start.<\/p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you all there!<\/p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne<\/p> ",

Along the way, she will discuss why each version of the plot fails in different ways and how each iteration improved on the last one.<\/p> <p>Alison is a data scientist &amp; professional educator at RStudio, where she works to help people learn and use programming to do better work in less time, with less friction, and (perhaps) more joy. She loves working with data scientists across the spectrum- from beginners to advanced users- and particularly enjoy using software tools to create educational materials that enlighten and engage learners. Topics Alison teaches range from literate programming to machine learning.

As most analyses require complete data, what to do with the missing values?<\/p> <p>An often used and easy solution to handle missing data is deleting incomplete rows and/or columns from the dataset. Is this method the most appropriate one, though? What other methods are available and what is their influence on the outcome of the analysis?<\/p> <p>The workshop has the following three parts.<br/>1. Missing Values Analysis<br/>What amount and what kind of missing data do I have in my dataset? What are possible reasons/mechanisms underlying the missingness?<br/>2. Evaluating Missing Data methods<br/>How do I know whether I choose the right missing data method? What should I take into account when deciding about a missing data method?<br/>3.

When I studied Methodology and Statistics, I co-developed a procedure to generate missing data in complete datasets. I implemented the procedure in R-function ampute, and it is now part of imputation package mice.<\/p> <p>Then, I worked as an external PhD candidate under supervision of dr. Gerko Vink and prof. dr. Stef van Buuren. My work focused on the effect of missing data on prediction oriented analyses. Unfortunately, I had to quit with my research when I changed jobs and no more funding was available.<\/p> <p>Now, I work at Samen Veilig Midden-Nederland (i.e. a youth care organization) as Developer Data &amp; Analytics. It is my job to structure and standardize the analyses of sensitive and highly classified data. I mainly work with databases and visualization software and I lead several projects.<\/p> <p>REQUIREMENTS<br/>------------------------<br/>A basic knowledge of R is required.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct.

    "description": "<p>Statistics on Street Corners: Bridging the gap between inferential and exploratory analysis using crowd-sourcing with data visualisation<\/p> <p>Plots of data often provoke the response \"is what we see really there\". In this talk we will discuss ways to give visual statistical methods an inferential framework. Statistical significance of \"graphical discoveries\" is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of null datasets: plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests, in a process modeled after the \"lineup\", popular from criminal legal procedures. This is a simple but rigorous protocol that provides valid inference, yielding p-values for graphical findings. The procedure can also be used to objectively decide the best choice of graphical display of the same data, for communicating information.<\/p> <p>Biography<\/p> <p>Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. She is a world leader in data visualisation, especially the visualisation of high-dimensional data using tours with low-dimensional projections, and projection pursuit.

Di is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, was recently the editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, and has been elected as an Ordinary Member of the R Foundation.

We will use the packages ggplot2 and nullabor.<\/p> <p>B. Plotting multiple dimensions in a single static plot, adding interaction: The building blocks to viewing high-dimensions are generalised pairs plots and parallel coordinate plots, available in the R package GGally. There are many variations and options that will be discussed, along with making these interactive with the plotly package.<\/p> <p>C. Using dynamic plots (tours) to examine models in the data space, beyond 3D: This part will cover the use of tours to examine multivariate spaces, in relation to dimension reduction techniques like principal component analysis and t-SNE, supervised and unsupervised classification models.

The idea is to create programs that are easier for users to understand. But they are also easier for programmers to work on and maintain. In this talk, I will describe how data scientists can be inspired by this programming approach and start what I refer to as \"literate projecting.\" Literate projects are not only more pleasant to work on -- they are also easier for others to discover and explore. In my experiences as a researcher and now a data scientist at RStudio, I've had the pleasure to work on many literate projects, and I've felt the pain of working on illiterate ones too. What is the difference? What are the benefits? Based on my experiences, I'll share good literate projecting practices that have the potential to shift your mindset and reshape your workflow.<\/p> <p>Biography<\/p> <p>Alison Hill is a Data Scientist &amp; Professional Educator on the RStudio Education team, whose mission is to train the next million R users globally.

If you can, please bring something to drink and/or some snacks to share!<\/p> <p>From R4DS: \"Join the R4DS online learning community in the weekly #TidyTuesday event! Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community! As such we encourage everyone of all skills to participate!”<\/p> <p>We encourage a mix of regular useRs and total beginners to encourage a collaborative co-learning space. Follow #tidytuesday on Twitter for some examples of visualisations created in the past. If you feel up to it, we encourage posting your own visualisation :)<\/p> ",

We will begin with the basics on networks and clustering before moving on to the algorithm and implementation that we chose to analyse the Scottish Economy. We then give an introduction to R Shiny, a package used to create interactive web apps, and show off our network visualisation and editing app. Finally, we will discuss how we can improve this ongoing project and future applications of our networking efforts in analysing the Scottish economy. We have used the `NetworkToolbox` library for the implementation of the main algorithm. The packages `dplyr` and `tidyr` were used for data manipulation, `plotly` and `igraph` are used for visualisations, and of course `Shiny` is used to build a convenient user interface. All data used will be made available for download, and the code will be shared via GitHub.<\/p> ",

It is told through Jahren’s stories: about her childhood in rural Minnesota with an uncompromising mother and a father who encouraged hours of play in his classroom’s labs; about how she found a sanctuary in science, and learned to perform lab work done “with both the heart and the hands”; and about the inevitable disappointments, but also the triumphs and exhilarating discoveries, of scientific work.<\/p> <p>Yet at the core of this book is the story of a relationship Jahren forged with a brilliant, wounded man named Bill, who becomes her lab partner and best friend.

I will be presenting some examples.<\/p> <p>Abstract<br/>Data wrangling is a critical foundation of data science, and wrangling of categorical data is an important component of this process. However, categorical data can introduce unique issues in data wrangling, particularly in real-world settings with collaborators and periodically-updated dynamic data. This paper discusses common problems arising from categorical variable transformations in R, demonstrates the use of factors, and suggests approaches to address data wrangling challenges. For each problem, we present at least two strategies for management, one in base R and the other from the ‘tidyverse.’ We consider several motivating examples, suggest defensive coding strategies, and outline principles for data wrangling to help ensure data quality and sound analysis.<\/p> ",

It should also be useful for programmers coming to R from other languages, as help you to understand why R works the way it does.\" - Hadley Wickham<\/p> <p>Come join us for coffee and #rstats as we tackle the book’s sections one at a time. Each book club session will have a leader to guide the discussion, and we encourage everyone to take a look at the material beforehand. The full text of the book is online for free at <a href=\"https://adv-r.hadley.nz/\" class=\"linkified\">https://adv-r.hadley.nz/<\/a>, and there's an exercise answer guide at <a href=\"https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Here’s the schedule:<br/>• Foundations - August 3, session leader was Amanda Tilot<br/>• Functional Programming - August 10, session leader was Amy Tzu-Yu Chen<br/>• OO Programming - split over August 24 (Base Types, S3, and R6) and September 7 (S4 and Trade-offs), session leader was Daniel Jacobs<br/>• **Metaprogramming - split over September 21 (Ch 17, 18, 19) and October 5 (Ch 20, 21), session leader will be Emil Hvitfeldt!**<br/>• Techniques - split over October 19 (Ch 22, 23) and November 2 (Ch 24, 25), session leaders will be Jake Kramer and Malcolm Barrett respectively!<\/p> <p>Advanced R dives deep into how R works as a language, and we highly recommend joining us for the first two sessions if you’re relatively new to R. We’re also looking for discussion leaders for the later sections of the book, so please reach out to Amy or Amanda if interested!<\/p> <p>This is a bring-your-own-coffee series, but we'll try to provide something sweet. As we're cohosting with the LA West RUG, all R users are welcome! Lastly, we expect all attendees to abide by the RLadies Code of Conduct, available here: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/rladies-la\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/rladies-la<\/a>.<\/p> <p>See you there!<br/>Amanda &amp; Amy<\/p> <p>\"This is the perfect book for someone who wants to understand R at a level slightly deeper than necessary for an analyst and less than a base R contributor. If you're interested in programming language design or at looking under the hood of R, this book rocks. \" - Goodreads review<\/p> <p>**To become more involved**<br/>Invite yourself to our SoCal R Users Slack group and join #adv-r-bookclub for discussions: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/laerug\" class=\"linkified\">http://bit.ly/laerug<\/a><br/>Check out more events: laocr.org/<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>For organisational reasons: please only RSVP \"yes\" if you actually plan to attend and don't forget to update your RSVP if needed!<\/p> <p>Otherwise: same place, same time, same spirit :)<\/p> <p>Agenda:<\/p> <p>18:00 Talk<\/p> <p>Federico Marini - iSEEing is believing: exploration of sequencing data, made easy and efficient<\/p> <p>Recent technological advancements in the life and medical sciences have allowed these fields to evolve into quantitative disciplines.<br/>Gene expression profiling with RNA-sequencing, protein quantification via mass spectrometry, high throughput imaging are complex assays that often require advanced methods for processing and generating actionable results. Notably, large and heterogeneous datasets need specific techniques also for the exploration, and I found that an effective combination of interactivity and reproducibility is essential for doing this properly.<\/p> <p>Interactive visualization can be a key player in this regard: for quality assessment of often noisy multivariate data, for hypothesis generation and exploration, for the visualization of results, as well as for the efficient communication of findings. Another essential aspect is that often the scientists generating the primary data might not be well versed in programming, notably increasing the iterations required to extract insight out of it.<\/p> <p>Many of these aspects are common in other fields than bioinformatics, and I will present in detail the functionality of a Bioconductor software I co-developed, iSEE (<a href=\"http://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/\" class=\"linkified\">http://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/<\/a>) as an application. Leveraging point-and-click user interfaces with guided tours, I will show how users can efficiently explore high-dimensional datasets, automatically retrieve the code for the generated output, and learn (by doing) how to generate compelling scientific figures.<\/p> <p>About Federico (<a href=\"https://federicomarini.github.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://federicomarini.github.io/<\/a>, @FedeBioinfo):<br/>I am a Postdoctoral Virchow Fellow at the Center for Thrombosis and Hemostasis (CTH) and at the Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI) in Mainz, Germany, where I can sit at the interface with many other disciplines and focus on translational bioinformatics. My research interests involve the development of methods and software for interactive and reproducible research, bringing together the fields of bioinformatics, statistics, genomics, and biology.<br/>I love working in the R programming language, and with software from the Bioconductor project, where I also contributed some packages over the years (pcaExplorer, ideal, iSEE).<\/p> <p>18:45 Talk<\/p> <p>Markus Nu - Deploying Shiny Apps in an Enterprise Context - ShinyProxy as an open source alternative<\/p> <p>After building your R Shiny app, you most often want to show it to others.<br/>Although Shiny Server provides an easy way to get started, in an enterprise context you soon reach a point where you want your users to authenticate and your applications to scale.<br/>ShinyProxy is an open source alternative to Shiny Server Pro, which has built-in functionality for user authentication and authorization, tracking and most importantly no limits on concurrent usage!<br/>In this talk we will see an end-2-end deployment with ShinyProxy, from running ShinyProxy as a docker container on a single machine, setting up an InfluxDB user tracking endpoint up to deploying your R Shiny application via ShinyProxy.<\/p> <p>About Markus: Markus is working as a Data Scientist at OBI next trying to discover interesting and meaningful patterns in data. He is excited by all kinds of data, big or small, logs or surveys, images or text. Prior to joining OBI next, he worked as a research analyst in market research. He studied Political Science (B.A.) and Survey and Data Science (M.Sc.) at the Universities of Mannheim and Maryland.<\/p> <p>Pizzas and drinks will be provided.<\/p> ",

More info on the book below. We hope to see you there!<\/p> <p>From Amazon about the book: \"Data is fundamental to the modern world. From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.<\/p> <p>Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in Invisible Women†‹, diving into women’s lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, unforgettable exposé that will change the way you look at the world.\"<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Talk 1:<br/>Speaker: Huiyu Deng, PhD candidate in Biostatistics, University of Southern California<br/>Title: A gentle Introduction Using R for Deep Learning<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Do you know that R can also develop and evaluate deep learning models using Keras, one of the most popular deep learning libraries in Python? In this presentation, I will introduce the steps to set up the platform to run Keras in R and give you an overview of the concepts of neural network (NN) and deep learning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN). In the end, we will analyze a dataset using the Keras package.<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Jo Hardin (@jo_hardin47), Professor, Pomona College<br/>Title: reticulate: running Python within RStudio<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>A quick google search can quickly bring up many arguments on both sides of the heated Python vs R debate. I don’t take sides in that conversation, but I do recognize the value of knowing both languages and the power of being able to use one language inside software designed for the other. Whatever computational environment is used to execute instructions to the computer, it can be illuminating to see different implementations of the same syntax producing the same results, or alternatively, implementation of different syntax producing the same result. In this talk, I discuss running Python in the RStudio environment. I provided a series of examples in R Markdown chunks (both Python chunks and R chunks). I include details for those working with Python in R for the first time.<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>Timeline:<br/>6:30: Socializing<br/>7:00-8:00: Talks<br/>8:00: Socializing<\/p> <p>Address:<br/>Room 115/116<br/>USC<br/>2001 N.

The Stack uses data to write stories, having produced interactive online articles with topics ranging from the easiest general education courses to the most common locations of sexual violence on campus. Data journalism is a rising field and a perfect combination of data science, story telling, and creativity. Two developers for The Stack, Keith and Jeanette, will present and explain the most recent story they collaborated on, \"To Stick or To Switch: Student Major Changes at UCLA.\" The article analyzes the rate at which students switch from one major to another. Through the process of data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and data transformations in R, they drew insightful findings from raw data and created visualizations to represent the trends. With the inclusion of student and staff interviews, their goal was to combine quantitative and qualitative data to write a holistic story that provides perspective for the campus community.<\/p> <p>** About Talk1 Speakers * 2 **<br/>Jeanette Lin:<br/>Jeanette is a fourth-year Statistics major at UCLA.

The goal is to make it easier to create the metadata needed by markdown, bookdown, blogdown and other frameworks used in R.<\/p> <p>R and Python are both popular languages in Data Science. There is no need to limit yourself to just one. Michael will show us how to incorporate python into your R workflow.<\/p> <p>Come early, network, enjoy the food and talks.<\/p> <p># Schedule<br/>6:30 - 6:50 Networking<br/>6:50 - 7:00 Welcome &amp; general announcement<br/>7:00 - 7:30 The YAML problem: Writing and working with YAML with ymlthis<br/>7:30 - 8:00 Snakes in the Studio: Adding Python to your R Workflow<br/>8:00 - Raffle<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Networking and Clean-up<\/p> <p># Talk 1<\/p> <p>## Title: The YAML problem: Writing and working with YAML with ymlthis<br/>## Speaker: Malcolm Barrett<br/>## Abstract<br/>R Markdown is an easy-to-learn tool for reproducible research. Many people, however, bump into problems using YAML, the language that specifies metadata for R Markdown documents. ymlthis makes it easy to write valid YAML by handling the syntax and documenting the majority of YAML fields in one place. ymlthis will help you write metadata for R Markdown, bookdown, blogdown, and more. Let the Shiny add-in create a new R Markdown file for you or work with YAML and R Markdown files directly. ymlthis finally gives you a workflow that is better than trying to find and paste the YAML from the last R Markdown document you used.<\/p> <p># Talk 2<\/p> <p>## Title: Snakes in the Studio: Adding Python to your R Workflow<br/>## Speaker: Michael Espero<br/>## Abstract<br/>R and Python are among the most widely used programming languages for analysts and data scientists. While it’s great to feel comfortable in one open-source statistical programming language, you may encounter peers who prefer another. This walk-through aims to share some of RStudio’s versatility as we touch on useful commonalities between data science workflows in R and Python with attention to simple approaches to loading, wrangling, visualizing, and modelling publicly available data.<\/p> ",

Alan, from RStudio, will give his much-anticipated talk on integrating React.js with Shiny. The reactR package has been updated to allow you to integrate with htmlwidgets and access all the React components. Emil will talk about his experience integrating the textrecipes into an ecosystem of packages and the lessons that he has learnt.

The React.js ecosystem is filled with components for doing everything from color selection (react-color) to animation (react-spring). While it's always been technically possible to integrate React.js components with Shiny applications, it hasn't always been particularly obvious how. To make it easier, we augmented the excellent reactR package with functions specifically designed to make it easier to create new htmlwidgets, inputs, and outputs based on React.js components. In this talk, I will further motivate and demonstrate these new tools and do my best to empower the audience to try them out.<\/p> <p># Talk 2<\/p> <p>## Title: Building a package that fits into an evolving ecosystem<br/>## Speaker: Emil Hvitfeldt<br/>## Abstract<br/>With an ever-increasing amount of textual data is available to us, having a well-thought-out toolchain for modelling is crucial. tidymodels is a recent effort to create a modelling framework that shares the underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures of the tidyverse. textrecipes joined the roster a year ago and provided an exciting bridge to text preprocessing. This talk tells the tale of the package textrecipes; starting with the Github issue that sparked the idea for the package, go over the trials and challenges associated with building a package that heavily integrates with other packages all the way to the release on CRAN.<\/p> ",

We will have two featured talks:<\/p> <p>*Michael Enquist* will be talking about Association Rules in R and how to apply them to grocery shopping. Association rules are statements that help to find patterns in seemingly unrelated data or a relational database (information repository). When we apply to a user purchasing a product, we will try to show five other products that the user is most likely to buy together with this product.<\/p> <p>Madeleine Bonsma-Fisher, Ahmed Hasan, and James Santangelo will be talking about a graduate student-led participatory live-coding quantitative methods course in R.<\/p> <p>Talk abstract: We are a group of graduate students at the University of Toronto who designed and launched an undergraduate course which teaches reproducible data analysis and computational methods to biology students using R. We'll talk about the gap in traditional undergraduate education that makes a course like this necessary, how we implemented it as hands-on workshop-style course, and what we learned about teaching programming in the process.<\/p> <p>Doors will open at 6:00pm, with talks kicking off at 6:30. After the talks you're welcome to stick around for some networking, and by 8:00 we'll leave the room (but may head somewhere nearby to continue the conversation!).<\/p> <p>The event will be held at Insight Data Science, so please remember to thank them.<\/p> <p>By attending, you agree to abide by our code of conduct which can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Titre complet : \"Rmd first\" : Quand le développement commence par la documentation (ou \"N'ayez pas peur de faire un package...\")<\/p> <p>Les analyses, les programmes R ou les packages sont plus faciles à utiliser et à maintenir lorsqu'ils sont correctement documentés. Cependant, la documentation semble prendre beaucoup de temps et, lorsqu'elle est incluse, elle est habituellement la dernière chose ajoutée à un projet. Pour un projet reproductible, les workflows peuvent être présentés dans un fichier Rmarkdown, combinant explications et analyses. Nous allons nous appuyer sur ce format Rmd pour s'assurer de la pérennité de nos travaux.<br/>Nous tenterons au passage de désacraliser la création de package.

As such, Shiny has always faced questions about whether it can or should be used “in production”. In this talk, we’ll explore what “production” even means, review some of the historical obstacles and objections to using Shiny for production purposes, and discuss practices and tools that can help your Shiny apps flourish.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Sean Lopp is a Product Manager at RStudio. Sean leads teams to create useful, enjoyable products. Before RStudio he was a data scientist and worked on alternative vehicle models at NREL, infant sleep dynamics, and originally studied mathematics.

    "description": "<p>R Studio Engineer and Charlotte's own Davis Vaughan will present:<br/>Business Calendars and Moving Averages - An Analyst’s Worst Nightmare<\/p> <p>A number of R packages exist to make computing moving averages on a single numeric series straightforward. But generally “real” life is much messier than that!<\/p> <p>Try computing a moving average over a twenty day sliding window when you have a time series with missing data. Oh! By the way, you should also skip over weekends when looking back twenty days. And you know that random holiday that your company celebrates that no one else does? Skip over that too.These are hard but realistic problems, and until now there has been a lack of tools necessary to solve them. In this talk, I’ll present two packages designed to tackle these issues, slide and almanac.<\/p> <p>slide is a package designed to perform arbitrary sliding window calculations. The simplest example of this would be a moving average. What makes slide unique is its support for sliding relative to an index, such as a date vector, which allows you to correctly compute the boundaries of that twenty day window.<\/p> <p>almanac is package for creating custom business calendars, and then adjusting dates relative to them. Inspired by lubridate, almanac allows you to shift dates by a set number of “business” days while respecting the weekends and holidays defined by a user-specified calendar. For example, shifting a Friday forward by 1 business day would land on a Monday, unless that Monday happened to be a holiday, in which case the next business day would actually be Tuesday.<\/p> <p>Together, slide and almanac provide the tooling necessary to solve the problem mentioned earlier. Additionally, because slide works with any arbitrary function, we can use the same procedure to compute rolling regressions, cumulative sums, and any other sliding computation.<\/p> ",

We would like to elect Organizing Committee consisting of 5-6 members, who would take on responsibility to serve the community in the next 12 months. Here are some of the topics that Organizing Committee will assume responsibility for:<br/>1) Recruiting speakers for the events<br/>2) Arranging venues<br/>3) Applying for and arranging sponsor support for the group<br/>4) Keeping community informed through timely announcements and event marketing<br/>5) Maintaining relationship with partner organizations, such as R-Ladies, global UseR network, and other meetups in Oslo.<\/p> <p>Based on the experience from last year, these duties should not take more than 3-4 hours per month, but we want to avoid the situation where everyone assumes somebody else is taking care of a particular issue and in the end no one steps up to the responsibility.<\/p> <p>Acting as a Meetup Organizer goes beyond the line on the resume. It means meeting new people, expanding your network and talking to colleagues in senior positions in data community. You also make yourself known to the wider community of R users around the world, get inspired to pursue cool projects and interesting ideas and generally grow as an R programmer and a data professional.<\/p> <p>We are hereby inviting you to nominate yourself to a community service position at the Oslo UseR Organizing Committee! If you have been enjoying our meetups, now you have the chance to make sure others can enjoy them, too!<\/p> <p>Please, post your name and a couple of sentences describing your motivation for serving at the Oslo UseR Organizing Committee for the year 2019/2020 here:<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/messages/boards/thread/52386458/0/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/messages/boards/thread/52386458/0/<\/a><\/p> <p>Thank you very much for your dedication to spreading knowledge of R and your support for Oslo UseR community!<\/p> <p>On behalf of interim Organizer Committee,<\/p> <p>Dmytro<\/p> ",

This is roughly my motto of continuous improvement and I'd like to share with the MelbURN community, a collection of learnings that I have acquired over the past few years. Whether it is following the DRY principle, or vowing to never write a for loop again, or learning to prepare recipes and bake them in R, a lot of things I have learnt have made me feel a lot better about how problems are tackled. Unlike other talks where you might learn about a particular package or technique, this talk will introduce you to some of the ways in which you can think about and be better at writing R code.<\/p> <p>Kaushik Lakshman is a data scientist and a massive fan of R. He works at Betfair where he uses R to analyse the incredibly rich and extensive betting exchange data, to create data products and create business value using data science. Outside of work he loves to have a go at building sports prediction models with the hope that one day it will help him retire at the beach (but has so far been very unsuccessful)!<\/p> <p>Second presentation: Getting your colleagues started with R<\/p> <p>R is fantastic piece of software which is widely used in academia and commercial sector – if you are coming to this talk then you are likely already a fan. In this presentation Lyndon will draw on his experience of teaching R to hundreds of academics and business professionals (and thousands of students) to discuss tips, tricks, and things to consider when introducing and teaching your colleagues how to use R. This will include different approaches to teaching and supporting colleagues, some useful tools and resources, and the different needs and support that your colleagues may require.<\/p> <p>Dr Lyndon Walker is a former statistics lecturer who is now a part-time statistician for SACS Consulting - a psychometrics and organisational psychology company, founder of Veritate Data Science - an education and statistics training consultancy, and investor/advisor to Preventure - a workplace safety wearable tech startup. He has used R for 22 years.<\/p> ",

Doors will open at 5:30PM where members can enjoy pizza, soda, and networking. The first talk will begin at 6:00PM. Included below are brief summaries of the topics covered in this meetup.<\/p> <p>Talk 1: Cybera’s tools and programs in support of data science in Alberta by Tatiana Meleshko and Graham Sucha<\/p> <p>An overview will be provided of the tools and projects Cybera - an Alberta based not-for-profit organization - makes available to folks interested in data science, including members of the CalgaryR group. Tools include our free general purpose Infrastructure as a Service environment, which also provides access to GPU resources. Recent results and plans to support K-12, entrepreneurs, and budding data scientists in Alberta through our Callysto and Data Science for Albertans projects will also be presented. Lastly, we seek input from CalgaryR members on a tool that the team has been working on, which strives to apply best practices from the software development world to data science projects through a structured framework. This will include a brief demo and overview of a roadmap of challenges we hope to address with the tool.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Practical Applications of Text Analysis / Natural Language Processing by Naoko Tomioka<\/p> <p>The field of text analysis is constantly evolving, and new tools and algorithms become available on a regular basis. Text analytic tools and packages range from low-level processing tools, such as tokenizer and entity extraction, to higher-level processing such as sentiment analysis and text classification. The applicability of each tool depends on the type of the data to be analysed and the intended use of the output. I will talk about several of my own projects in order to illustrate the process of selecting the best tools, and what text analysis looks like in a business context.<\/p> <p>Talk 3: Community Development - Calgary Artificial Intelligence Meetup by Drew Gilson<\/p> <p>Drew Gillson is a technologist, entrepreneur, and community leader. In addition to organizing the Calgary Artificial Intelligence Meetup, Drew works for Looker, a data analytics software company that is being acquired by Google. Drew has been an active member of the Calgary innovation ecosystem since the dark ages of 2001. He’ll share some highlights and learnings from his remarkable journey, in the hope that it will inspire you to also take the road less traveled.<\/p> <p>This event is supported by the Pacific Institutes of the Mathematical Sciences and the Bow Valley College.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>We have more time series, this month from Jeff Ryan, the creator of the xts and quantmod packages.<\/p> <p>Thank you to the Visiting Nurse Service of New York for hosting us at the Daily Planet (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2IryeJZ\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2IryeJZ<\/a>), I mean Daily News, Building<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Time series are everywhere, and fundamentally different than all other data. To effectively work with these series demands highly specialized tools--as dates, times, notation, calendars, time zones, and more must be carefully managed while doing even basic operations like subsetting, merging, aggregating and dealing with missingness. If not handled properly, all of your analysis could be at risk. Specialized tools for time have been part of R since the beginning, but have seen enormous changes over the last decade. In this talk we’ll explore where we started, what we have now and what might be on the horizon. I'll try to show the whole story in code and tell my unique perspective as someone who’s been lucky enough to be part of its history--and actively working on crafting its future for R, and beyond.<\/p> <p>About Jeff:<br/>Jeff Ryan is a practitioner in the quantitative hedge fund space and a long time contributor to R in both finance and data management. He introduced quantmod and xts in 2007, and co-founded the successful R/Finance conference, held annually since 2009. Over the years he's watched how time series went from an esoteric topic to the hottest thing in databases. He thinks this increased focus is only getting started. He's a bit opinionated, and enjoys building simple but powerful tools that can stand the test of time. Jeff is currently working on what he believes is be the next big step in time series management.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>\"Transitioning into the tidyverse\"<\/p> <p>• Description:<br/>Most people who learned R before the tidyverse have likely started to feel a nibble of pressure to get aboard the tidyverse train. Sadly a fact of human nature is that once you’re comfortable doing something a certain way, it’s hard to find the motivation to learn a different way of doing something that you already know how to do. While the tidyverse is primarily made up of a set of super useful R packages (ggplot2, dplyr, purrr, tidyr, readr, tibble), it is also a way of thinking about implementing “tidy” data analysis. If you combine tidy thinking with the tidy packages, you will inevitably become a master of tidy analysis. This talk will provide a guide for easing into the tidyverse for new users by first focusing on piping, dplyr, and ggplot2, and then providing short summaries and references for the remaining packages that form the tidyverse (and how they play together). Additional resources for continuing your tidyverse journey will be provided.<\/p> <p>• Target audience:<br/>People familiar with base R who want to familiarize themselves with the tidyverse, as well as those who have a little experience with the tidyverse and want a big picture of how it all fits together.<\/p> <p>The talk will be a combination of slides and live-coding, and is based on my two-part blog post on the tidyverse: <a href=\"http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/<\/a><\/p> <p>• Bio:<br/>Rebecca is a Statistics PhD Student at UC Berkeley as well as a Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS). Her dual passions are explaining “seemingly complicated” concepts to others in plain English, and exploring and presenting the stories that underlie complex datasets. She has dabbled in writing software as the author of the superheat R package for creating beautiful and customizable heatmaps in R. Rebecca also writes blog posts about R and statistics over at her website, www.rebeccabarter.com. When she's not doing R or stats stuff, she can usually be found climbing rocks somewhere, taking photos of beautiful places, or throwing wonky mugs and bowls at the pottery studio!<\/p> <p>================================================<br/>AGENDA:<br/>5:30pm - 6pm: Help with the setup (install R packages and anything else that is needed for the workshop)<br/>6pm - 6:30pm: Networking<br/>6:30pm - 7:45pm: Workshop<br/>7:45pm - 8pm: Networking<\/p> <p>================================================<br/>• Important to know<br/>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>Anyone who violates or has previously violated this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, meetup membership or other condition.<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a><\/p> <p>• The mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community.<\/p> <p>We are emphatically queer and trans-friendly.<\/p> <p>• Refreshments and food will be provided.<\/p> <p>A huge thank you to Sojern (<a href=\"https://www.sojern.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sojern.com/<\/a>) for hosting us!<\/p> ",

As one of several alternative approaches to forecasting future trends using past information, ARIMA is a flexible but also powerful ‘semi-parametric’ method for forecasting and fitting longitudinal (aka panel) data, and there is also a user-friendly R implementation. In contrast to more inferential tools like Cox survival models, ARIMA models can make useful, potentially more accurate forward predictions with relatively sparse datasets, and they can be very useful for surfacing initial evidence of causal trends for further validation.<\/p> <p>ARIMA can be used for everything from forecasting highly seasonal sales trends for food products, to the main example we’ll work through: surfacing a potential link between delayed discharges of hospitalised NHS patients and the unusual increase in English mortality rates since 2015.<\/p> <p>The workshop does not presuppose any prior experience with time series/panel data analysis, but it will be helpful to have some statistical background as well as basic R skills. Bring your laptops! Data and code will be circulated on Github.<\/p> <p>The talk will be given by Jules Shen, who is a statistical consultant with the Health Foundation, working primarily with the Improvement Analytics Unit. She is also a part-time PhD student in public health and policy at the LSHTM, who previously worked in development/health economics and management consultancy. Jules’ wife has worked out that her optimal day is a generalised linear function of pet budgies + ramen noodles.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<\/p> <p>6pm - snacks and networking for R-Ladies and hosts [lower ground floor downstairs; LSHTM refectory]<\/p> <p>6:30ish pm – workshop starts!

Az EDA alapvető fontosságú első lépés, megalapozza az adattisztítást, az adattranszformációt és a hipotézis felállítását. Miért? Mert ahhoz, hogy az adatot megtisztítsuk, tudnunk kell hol „piszkos” és milyen problémák vannak vele, az adatok transzformálása előtt pedig érdemes megismerni, hogy milyen értékekből tudunk dolgozni. A folyamat másik célja mintázatok, összefüggések megfigyelése az adathalmazban, amik mentén az elemzés későbbi lépéseiben tovább haladhatunk.<\/p> <p>Az anyag a 2019-es UseR! konferencián, Di Cook által tartott „Visualising High-Dimensional Data” című tutorial alapján állt össze. A workshopon röviden ismertetésre kerül az EDA története és fontosabb eszközei, ezután kódolás következik!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Every Monday the R for Data Science (R4DS) releases a new dataset on their GitHub that has been tamed, but does not always adhere to “tidy” data principles. This dataset will come from an article with an interesting plot. Our goal is to take a look at the raw data, and generate either a copy of the original plot or a novel take on the data! You can obviously use whatever techniques you feel are appropriate, but the data will be organized in a way that tidyverse tools will work well!<\/p> <p>We will come together and work in teams helping each other solve this weeks TidyTuesday challenge. TidyTuesdays are a great way to improve R skills and get involved in the community!<\/p> <p>* To participate in TidyTuesday, you need to do a few things *<\/p> <p>Create and save an image of a plot from R<br/>- Save the code used to recreate your plot (include data tidy steps!)<br/>- Submit the plot and code on Twitter<br/>- Use the #TidyTuesday hashtag (you can also tag me @thomas_mock)<br/>- Browse other submissions and like/comment on their work!<\/p> <p>However, that might seem like a lot! So at minimum please submit your plot with the hashtag #TidyTuesday.<\/p> <p>* Rules for TidyTuesday *<\/p> <p>We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts to participate, but be mindful of a few things:<\/p> <p>- This is NOT about criticizing the original authors. They are people like you and me and they have feelings. Focus on the data, the charts and improving your own techniques.<br/>- This is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow #RStats practitioners! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like other’s posts and help promote the #RStats community!<br/>- The data set comes from the source article or the source that the article credits. Be mindful that the data is what it is and Tidy Tuesday is designed to help you practice data visualization and basic data wrangling.<br/>- Use the hashtag #TidyTuesday on Twitter if you create your own version and would like to share it.<br/>- Include a picture of the visualisation when you post to Twitter.<br/>- Include a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to Twitter. Comment your code wherever possible to help yourself and others understand your process!<br/>- Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with someting simple! - Make something quick, but purposeful!<br/>- Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.<\/p> ",

    "start": "2019-10-16",
    "description": "<p>As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome! After the talks we’ll be testing out a new pub (details below), so do come along!<\/p> <p>Our first speaker is Colin Rundel, Lecturer in Mathematical Sciences within the School of Mathematics (UoE), and Assistant Professor of the Practice in Statistical Science at Duke University. Colin will be focusing on how to use GitHub for teaching:<\/p> <p># ghclass: an R package for managing classes with GitHub<\/p> <p>In this talk I will present the details of the ghclass package which has been developed as a tool for managing statistical and data science courses with a computation component. The package is designed to automate the process of distributing and collecting assignments via git repositories hosted on GitHub. As part of this talk I will discuss how these tools are being used to teach a large MSc Statistical Computing course here at the University of Edinburgh. I will provide a live demo of the package’s core functionality as well as demonstrate some of the newer features which focus on automated feedback and assessment.<br/>---<\/p> <p>Our second speaker is Greg Sutcliffe. Greg is a Community Data Scientist at Red Hat, focusing mainly on supporting the Ansible and Foreman communities. He’s interested how data can be used to guide their governance, particularly at scale. He will be discussing:<\/p> <p># Running your own Shiny Server<\/p> <p>Is the free tier of Shinyapps.io too restrictive? Or you need something internal perhaps? If, like me, you’ve got CPU time and no budget, running your own Shiny server is a compelling option. In this demo, we’ll take a clean Debian virtual machine, get Shiny Server up and running, add an Apache frontend, and throw in some LetsEncrypt for SSL goodness. We might even have time to look into how to deploy apps to it from within RStudio.<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hi everyone! We're kicking off our first event in October, sponsored by trivago (<a href=\"https://www.trivago.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.trivago.com/<\/a>), with three short talks:<\/p> <p>• How to find, evaluate and launch data business ideas (Daniel Kupka)<br/>• Practical reproducibility of analyses (Alex Dolphin)<br/>• Shiny development in an academic vs business setting (Praer Owlarn)<\/p> <p>*** Agenda ***<br/>• 18:30 - 19:00: Arrival, get a drink and socialise<br/>• 19:00 - 19:10: Quick introduction<br/>• 19:10 - 19:30: Daniel's Talk + Q&amp;A<br/>• 19:30 - 19:50: Alex's Talk + Q&amp;A<br/>• 19:50 - 20:10: Praer's Talk + Q&amp;A<br/>• 20:10 - Open End: Socialising<\/p> <p>*** How to find, evaluate and launch data business ideas (Daniel Kupka) ***<\/p> <p>\"For every business advice, there is equally someone smart who says the opposite\" - Jason Cohen, Founder WPEngine.<br/>This is not going to be a lecture on the latest and hottest startup advice but rather a story on how I came up with my business idea, evaluated it´s potential using R and tested it with customers in real life.<\/p> <p>Daniel Kupka is an Economist by training and an entrepreneur at heart. After leaving his job at OECD without a plan, he tried various business models to pursue the \"entrepreneurial dream\" while freelancing on the side. But after much trial-and-error, FrontPage Data (<a href=\"https://frontpagedata.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://frontpagedata.com<\/a>), a Data Journalism on-Demand service, got some traction in the content marketing niche.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>*** Practical reproducibility of analyses (Alex Dolphin) ***<\/p> <p>In the pursuit of robust, reproducible, and extendable analyses, one key aspect frequently gets overlooked: practicality. Reproducible analyses with a potential for good review are often cumbersome to write: they may require branches to be pulled, environments to be built, and variables to be changed in a well-hidden file. I will propose a step towards greater practicality with an example using three technologies many data scientists know to some extent:<br/>- RMarkdown<br/>- R shiny server<br/>- Docker<\/p> <p>By presenting this concept I hope to demonstrate that it is possible for:<br/>- data scientists to review the live code with one link to a shiny-rendered page<br/>- non-data-scientists to rerun and extend the analysis through an intuitive GUI<br/>- the data scientist doing the task to achieve this only writing one file in their preferred coding language<\/p> <p>Alex Dolphin is a Data Scientist in the Marketplace Intelligence team of trivago. He has worked for 3 years in the Data Science function, and comes from a background of Mathematics at university. He believes that data scientists should have access to highly-reliable data and well-maintained tools as a minimum to produce quality output.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>*** Shiny development in an academic vs business setting (Praer Owlarn) ***<\/p> <p>Shiny is a popular R package for building interactive web apps – no web development knowledge required (<a href=\"https://shiny.rstudio.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://shiny.rstudio.com<\/a>)! Its ease-of-use and extendibility makes it popular in both academic and business settings, but implementation in the two environments can be rather different. I’ll share my experience writing shiny apps at a Max Planck Institute (a non-profit research institute) and trivago (a German hotel search engine), and how differences in task complexity, IT infrastructure and organisational mindset affected my approaches and the packages I used.<\/p> <p>Praer Owlarn is a data analyst at trivago. After a decade as a biologist, she decided to learn a little R and immediately fell in love! Soon, she waved goodbye to the bench and is now having fun diving into big data sets, exploring/contributing to R packages and building shiny apps.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Thanks to trivago for hosting &amp; sponsoring this edition of the Düsseldorf R User Group Meetup. There will be food and drinks available.<\/p> ",

In this collection Justice Ginsburg discusses gender equality, the workings of the Supreme Court, being Jewish, law and lawyers in opera, and the value of looking beyond US shores when interpreting the US Constitution. Throughout her life Justice Ginsburg has been (and continues to be) a prolific writer and public speaker. This book’s sampling is selected by Justice Ginsburg and her authorized biographers Mary Hartnett and Wendy W. Williams, who introduce each chapter and provide biographical context and quotes gleaned from hundreds of interviews they have conducted.<\/p> <p>Witty, engaging, serious, and playful, My Own Words is a fascinating glimpse into the life of one of America’s most influential women and “a tonic to the current national discourse” (The Washington Post).<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>This is talk is to introduce students of R to the data.table package. Why use data.table? The data.table package offers a very fast tabular data object and a suite of functions that can satisfy many of the data processing requirements an analyst will encounter. The syntax is very similar to operating on base R's data.frame object, so it is relatively quick to learn for those used to working with data.frame. Programming with the data.table package can produce terse, elegant code. Those who prefer doing more with less typing will appreciate the workflow.<\/p> <p>In short, data.table is quick to learn, quick to type, and offers some of the most performant tabular data operations found in R. We hope you will join us!<\/p> <p>Author Bio:<\/p> <p>Jason Taylor has been using R professionally since 2011, and has previously given talks and workshops on programming in R and Python.

    "start": "2019-10-22",
    "description": "<p>**Meeting location: 55 Washington St, Brooklyn, NY, Floor 8**<\/p> <p>Our speakers for the night will be Emily H Ho from Fordham and Samuel Crane from Amplify. Emily will be talking about working with psychological scales in R. Samuel will be talking about building a data dictionary using blogdown.<\/p> <p>Speakers:<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30-6:45 pm Introductions and Social<br/>6:45-6:55 pm R-Ladies New York Announcements<br/>6:55-7:25 pm Developing and Validating a Psychological Scale in R<br/>7:25-7:55 pm Amplify, Blogdown and the Central Source of Truth<br/>7:55-8:00 pm Community Announcements<br/>8:00-8:30 pm Networking<\/p> <p>Title: Developing and Validating a Psychological Scale in R<\/p> <p>Abstract: If you've ever taken a personality quiz online or a career assessment at school (or that high-stakes college admissions test which shall not be named), you've come into contact with a validated scale. Using a recently developed scale as an example, I will walk through the process of how to create such a measure, from generating items to seeing the latent relationships between the items, testing for validity, and finally, how to ensure that the scale works 'in the wild'.<\/p> <p>Bio: Emily H Ho is a behavioral scientist pursuing her PhD in psychometrics and quantitative psychology at Fordham. Her work develops and applies new methods to improve decision-making in areas like health, climate change, and intelligence analysis. She has previously worked at The College Board conducting analyses on test validity and reliability. Follow her on Twitter at @emilyhho.<\/p> <p>Title: Amplify, Blogdown and the Central Source of Truth<\/p> <p>Abstract: Having a central source of truth for all data descriptions is critical to the development of data literacy within an organization, but data dictionaries are tricky to maintain. This talk will discuss how I am solving this problem at Amplify by using R to develop a website with blogdown and then leveraging the Looker API and a custom metadata store to deliver comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date information about our data.<\/p> <p>Bio: Samuel is the Director of Data Science at Amplify, an educational technology company based in Brooklyn, NY. He leads a team of data scientists focusing on analytics, algorithm development, and measuring the impact of Amplify’s curricula and assessments. Samuel is interested in statistical programming, reproducible research, data visualization, and the role of data in product development. Formerly a biologist and now a manager and data scientist, he loves to chat about building teams, the transition from academia to industry, beetles (his former obsession), and collecting wine.<\/p> ",
