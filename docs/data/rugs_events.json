    "description": "<p>Talk 1:<br/>Speaker: Huiyu Deng, PhD candidate in Biostatistics, University of Southern California<br/>Title: A gentle Introduction Using R for Deep Learning<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Do you know that R can also develop and evaluate deep learning models using Keras, one of the most popular deep learning libraries in Python? In this presentation, I will introduce the steps to set up the platform to run Keras in R and give you an overview of the concepts of neural network (NN) and deep learning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN). In the end, we will analyze a dataset using the Keras package.<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Jo Hardin (@jo_hardin47), Professor, Pomona College<br/>Title: reticulate: running Python within RStudio<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>A quick google search can quickly bring up many arguments on both sides of the heated Python vs R debate. I don’t take sides in that conversation, but I do recognize the value of knowing both languages and the power of being able to use one language inside software designed for the other. Whatever computational environment is used to execute instructions to the computer, it can be illuminating to see different implementations of the same syntax producing the same results, or alternatively, implementation of different syntax producing the same result. In this talk, I discuss running Python in the RStudio environment. I provided a series of examples in R Markdown chunks (both Python chunks and R chunks). I include details for those working with Python in R for the first time.<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>Timeline:<br/>6:30: Socializing<br/>7:00-8:00: Talks<br/>8:00: Socializing<\/p> <p>Address:<br/>Room 115/116<br/>USC<br/>2001 N.

    "description": "<p># Introduction<\/p> <p>Malcolm has been interning with RStudio and working on a package, ymlthis, which will allow you too write YAML code using R. The goal is to make it easier to create the metadata needed by markdown, bookdown, blogdown and other frameworks used in R.<\/p> <p>R and Python are both popular languages in Data Science. There is no need to limit yourself to just one. Michael will show us how to incorporate python into your R workflow.<\/p> <p>Come early, network, enjoy the food and talks.<\/p> <p># Schedule<br/>6:30 - 6:50 Networking<br/>6:50 - 7:00 Welcome &amp; general announcement<br/>7:00 - 7:30 The YAML problem: Writing and working with YAML with ymlthis<br/>7:30 - 8:00 Snakes in the Studio: Adding Python to your R Workflow<br/>8:00 - Raffle<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Networking and Clean-up<\/p> <p># Talk 1<\/p> <p>## Title: The YAML problem: Writing and working with YAML with ymlthis<br/>## Speaker: Malcolm Barrett<br/>## Abstract<br/>R Markdown is an easy-to-learn tool for reproducible research. Many people, however, bump into problems using YAML, the language that specifies metadata for R Markdown documents. ymlthis makes it easy to write valid YAML by handling the syntax and documenting the majority of YAML fields in one place. ymlthis will help you write metadata for R Markdown, bookdown, blogdown, and more. Let the Shiny add-in create a new R Markdown file for you or work with YAML and R Markdown files directly. ymlthis finally gives you a workflow that is better than trying to find and paste the YAML from the last R Markdown document you used.<\/p> <p># Talk 2<\/p> <p>## Title: Snakes in the Studio: Adding Python to your R Workflow<br/>## Speaker: Michael Espero<br/>## Abstract<br/>R and Python are among the most widely used programming languages for analysts and data scientists. While it’s great to feel comfortable in one open-source statistical programming language, you may encounter peers who prefer another. This walk-through aims to share some of RStudio’s versatility as we touch on useful commonalities between data science workflows in R and Python with attention to simple approaches to loading, wrangling, visualizing, and modelling publicly available data.<\/p> ",

Association rules are statements that help to find patterns in seemingly unrelated data or a relational database (information repository). When we apply to a user purchasing a product, we will try to show five other products that the user is most likely to buy together with this product.<\/p> <p>Madeleine Bonsma-Fisher, Ahmed Hasan, and James Santangelo will be talking about a graduate student-led participatory live-coding quantitative methods course in R.<\/p> <p>Talk abstract: We are a group of graduate students at the University of Toronto who designed and launched an undergraduate course which teaches reproducible data analysis and computational methods to biology students using R. We'll talk about the gap in traditional undergraduate education that makes a course like this necessary, how we implemented it as hands-on workshop-style course, and what we learned about teaching programming in the process.<\/p> <p>Doors will open at 6:00pm, with talks kicking off at 6:30.

But generally “real” life is much messier than that!<\/p> <p>Try computing a moving average over a twenty day sliding window when you have a time series with missing data. Oh! By the way, you should also skip over weekends when looking back twenty days. And you know that random holiday that your company celebrates that no one else does? Skip over that too.These are hard but realistic problems, and until now there has been a lack of tools necessary to solve them. In this talk, I’ll present two packages designed to tackle these issues, slide and almanac.<\/p> <p>slide is a package designed to perform arbitrary sliding window calculations. The simplest example of this would be a moving average. What makes slide unique is its support for sliding relative to an index, such as a date vector, which allows you to correctly compute the boundaries of that twenty day window.<\/p> <p>almanac is package for creating custom business calendars, and then adjusting dates relative to them. Inspired by lubridate, almanac allows you to shift dates by a set number of “business” days while respecting the weekends and holidays defined by a user-specified calendar. For example, shifting a Friday forward by 1 business day would land on a Monday, unless that Monday happened to be a holiday, in which case the next business day would actually be Tuesday.<\/p> <p>Together, slide and almanac provide the tooling necessary to solve the problem mentioned earlier. Additionally, because slide works with any arbitrary function, we can use the same procedure to compute rolling regressions, cumulative sums, and any other sliding computation.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Dear R-enthusiasts,<\/p> <p>You might have noticed that we announced community meeting on 15 October 2019. The purpose of this event is to look back at the events we enjoyed last year, celebrate growth and diversity of our community and discuss the road ahead. We will have a few lightning talks (10-15 min) on diverse subjects and leave time for discussions and reflections on how UseR meetups helped you grow or learn in the last year.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure constant flow of fun and useful events, we need to have people organizing them and making sure speakers, venues and practicalities are taken care of in time for every new UseR meeting. We would like to elect Organizing Committee consisting of 5-6 members, who would take on responsibility to serve the community in the next 12 months. Here are some of the topics that Organizing Committee will assume responsibility for:<br/>1) Recruiting speakers for the events<br/>2) Arranging venues<br/>3) Applying for and arranging sponsor support for the group<br/>4) Keeping community informed through timely announcements and event marketing<br/>5) Maintaining relationship with partner organizations, such as R-Ladies, global UseR network, and other meetups in Oslo.<\/p> <p>Based on the experience from last year, these duties should not take more than 3-4 hours per month, but we want to avoid the situation where everyone assumes somebody else is taking care of a particular issue and in the end no one steps up to the responsibility.<\/p> <p>Acting as a Meetup Organizer goes beyond the line on the resume. It means meeting new people, expanding your network and talking to colleagues in senior positions in data community. You also make yourself known to the wider community of R users around the world, get inspired to pursue cool projects and interesting ideas and generally grow as an R programmer and a data professional.<\/p> <p>We are hereby inviting you to nominate yourself to a community service position at the Oslo UseR Organizing Committee! If you have been enjoying our meetups, now you have the chance to make sure others can enjoy them, too!<\/p> <p>Please, post your name and a couple of sentences describing your motivation for serving at the Oslo UseR Organizing Committee for the year 2019/2020 here:<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/messages/boards/thread/52386458/0/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/messages/boards/thread/52386458/0/<\/a><\/p> <p>Thank you very much for your dedication to spreading knowledge of R and your support for Oslo UseR community!<\/p> <p>On behalf of interim Organizer Committee,<\/p> <p>Dmytro<\/p> ",

For instance, one of the main challenges in computer vision is the amount of data being processed: one image is represented as matrix with millions of entries, and a video is just multiple images stacked together. Another challenge with video processing is the presence of noise<br/>While ongoing research addresses these drawbacks, alternative methods can be explored. One of them is the concept of tensor decomposition which is particularly powerful in a high dimensional data context and can provide useful pre-processing stage before applying any deep learning model.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<\/p> <p>Rene Essomba is an Analytics manager at TAL Australia, one of the largest life insurance in Australia. As a member of the Member Analytics and Research team, his role is to help with the implementation of advanced analytics solutions to support the members of TAL's Group insurance partners. He is also a part-time student with Georgia Institute of Technology doing the online masters in computational data analytics.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Two separate topics for this meetup;<br/>Exploring Longitudinal data with the brolgar package<br/>Productionising models in AWS using SageMaker<\/p> <p>Thanks again to Servian for venue and catering!<\/p> <p>Rough agenda:<br/>5:45: Networking, food &amp; drinks<br/>6:15 First presentation<br/>7:00 Second presentation<br/>7:45 More networking<br/>8:30 Close<\/p> <p>First presentation: Making better spaghetti (plots): Exploring the individuals in longitudinal data with the brolgar package<\/p> <p>Longitudinal (panel) data provide the opportunity to examine temporal patterns of individuals, because measurements are collected on the same person at different, and often irregular, time points. The data is typically visualised using a \"spaghetti plot\", where a line plot is drawn for each individual. When overlaid in one plot, it can have the appearance of a bowl of spaghetti. With even a small number of subjects, these plots are too overloaded to be read easily. The interesting aspects of individual differences are lost in the noise.<\/p> <p>Longitudinal data is often modeled with a hierarchical linear model to capture the overall trends, and variation among individuals, while accounting for various levels of dependence. However, these models can be difficult to fit, and can miss unusual individual patterns. Better visual tools can help to diagnose longitudinal models, and better capture the individual experiences.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Nick will introduce the R package, **brolgar** (BRowse over Longitudinal data Graphically and Analytically in R), which provides tools to identify and summarise interesting individual patterns in longitudinal data.<\/p> <p>Dr. Nick Tierney completed his PhD in Statistics at QUT and is now a Lecturer at Monash University. Nick's research aims to improve data analysis workflow. This includes statistical modelling, calculating diagnostics, drawing inferences and making decisions. Crucial to this work is producing high quality software to accompany each research idea. His work so far has focussed on the importance of knowing your data ( in the R package, visdat ), and on creating principles and tools that make it easier to work with, explore, and model missing data (in the R package, naniar). Nick has also created an optimisation model that identifies and possibly relocates facilities to maximise their coverage on a population, in the R package maxcovr. Nick loves the R programming language and how it has transformed his world. He is a proud member of the rOpenSci community, a collective that works to make science open using R, and co-host a podcast with Dr. Saskia Freytag about everything #rstats named “Credibly Curious”.<\/p> <p>Second presentation: Building Scalable Production-Ready R model using AWS<\/p> <p>In this growing world of Machine Learning, we often roam around creating POCs (proof-of-concepts), but an important aspect that is often forgotten is how we bring models from POC and into production. The thing is, productionising your model and ensuring scalability is not as easy as a click of a button or minor code change. Even after you get your model into production, we must re-evaluate our model, perform A/B testing and redeploy our model. This is all part of the data science pipeline. All of these steps are time-consuming and require many configurational changes.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, Jeno will present how everyday data scientists can take the model they have built-in R, productionise it with the use of Docker and AWS SageMaker at ease. This will cover the training, deployment, A/B testing of the model you have built using R and some aspects of AWS and Docker.<\/p> <p>As a Consultant at Servian, Jeno has been helping various businesses build scalable data and cloud solutions in the areas of AI/ML, Data Warehousing, Data Migration, Serverless, and Containers. He holds a Master of Data Science degree from Monash University and is a lover for R. When he is not busy roaming around Medium on the latest tech and analysing and modeling in R, he competes in Hackathons and Datathons around Melbourne.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>**We are meeting at the Bow Valley College! Thank you very much for this venue support!**<\/p> <p>Three speakers are contributing to our meetup in October. Doors will open at 5:30PM where members can enjoy pizza, soda, and networking. The first talk will begin at 6:00PM. Included below are brief summaries of the topics covered in this meetup.<\/p> <p>Talk 1: Cybera’s tools and programs in support of data science in Alberta by Tatiana Meleshko and Graham Sucha<\/p> <p>An overview will be provided of the tools and projects Cybera - an Alberta based not-for-profit organization - makes available to folks interested in data science, including members of the CalgaryR group. Tools include our free general purpose Infrastructure as a Service environment, which also provides access to GPU resources. Recent results and plans to support K-12, entrepreneurs, and budding data scientists in Alberta through our Callysto and Data Science for Albertans projects will also be presented. Lastly, we seek input from CalgaryR members on a tool that the team has been working on, which strives to apply best practices from the software development world to data science projects through a structured framework. This will include a brief demo and overview of a roadmap of challenges we hope to address with the tool.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Practical Applications of Text Analysis / Natural Language Processing by Naoko Tomioka<\/p> <p>The field of text analysis is constantly evolving, and new tools and algorithms become available on a regular basis. Text analytic tools and packages range from low-level processing tools, such as tokenizer and entity extraction, to higher-level processing such as sentiment analysis and text classification. The applicability of each tool depends on the type of the data to be analysed and the intended use of the output. I will talk about several of my own projects in order to illustrate the process of selecting the best tools, and what text analysis looks like in a business context.<\/p> <p>Talk 3: Community Development - Calgary Artificial Intelligence Meetup by Drew Gilson<\/p> <p>Drew Gillson is a technologist, entrepreneur, and community leader. In addition to organizing the Calgary Artificial Intelligence Meetup, Drew works for Looker, a data analytics software company that is being acquired by Google. Drew has been an active member of the Calgary innovation ecosystem since the dark ages of 2001. He’ll share some highlights and learnings from his remarkable journey, in the hope that it will inspire you to also take the road less traveled.<\/p> <p>This event is supported by the Pacific Institutes of the Mathematical Sciences and the Bow Valley College.<\/p> ",

To effectively work with these series demands highly specialized tools--as dates, times, notation, calendars, time zones, and more must be carefully managed while doing even basic operations like subsetting, merging, aggregating and dealing with missingness. If not handled properly, all of your analysis could be at risk. Specialized tools for time have been part of R since the beginning, but have seen enormous changes over the last decade. In this talk we’ll explore where we started, what we have now and what might be on the horizon. I'll try to show the whole story in code and tell my unique perspective as someone who’s been lucky enough to be part of its history--and actively working on crafting its future for R, and beyond.<\/p> <p>About Jeff:<br/>Jeff Ryan is a practitioner in the quantitative hedge fund space and a long time contributor to R in both finance and data management. He introduced quantmod and xts in 2007, and co-founded the successful R/Finance conference, held annually since 2009. Over the years he's watched how time series went from an esoteric topic to the hottest thing in databases. He thinks this increased focus is only getting started. He's a bit opinionated, and enjoys building simple but powerful tools that can stand the test of time. Jeff is currently working on what he believes is be the next big step in time series management.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>\"Transitioning into the tidyverse\"<\/p> <p>• Description:<br/>Most people who learned R before the tidyverse have likely started to feel a nibble of pressure to get aboard the tidyverse train. Sadly a fact of human nature is that once you’re comfortable doing something a certain way, it’s hard to find the motivation to learn a different way of doing something that you already know how to do. While the tidyverse is primarily made up of a set of super useful R packages (ggplot2, dplyr, purrr, tidyr, readr, tibble), it is also a way of thinking about implementing “tidy” data analysis. If you combine tidy thinking with the tidy packages, you will inevitably become a master of tidy analysis. This talk will provide a guide for easing into the tidyverse for new users by first focusing on piping, dplyr, and ggplot2, and then providing short summaries and references for the remaining packages that form the tidyverse (and how they play together). Additional resources for continuing your tidyverse journey will be provided.<\/p> <p>• Target audience:<br/>People familiar with base R who want to familiarize themselves with the tidyverse, as well as those who have a little experience with the tidyverse and want a big picture of how it all fits together.<\/p> <p>The talk will be a combination of slides and live-coding, and is based on my two-part blog post on the tidyverse: <a href=\"http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/<\/a><\/p> <p>• Bio:<br/>Rebecca is a Statistics PhD Student at UC Berkeley as well as a Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS).

If the book includes exercises the meeting offers the opportunity to compare each others answers and work on more difficult problems together.<\/p> <p>The first book we will work through is the R for Data Science book (available online: <a href=\"https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\" class=\"linkified\">https://r4ds.had.co.nz/<\/a> ), each fortnight we will discuss one of the sections: Explore, Wrangle, Program, Model, Communicate.<\/p> <p>In this meetup we are looking at Section II - Wrangle.<br/>We will focus on data import and getting your data into a 'tidy' format, from there it is then much easier to transform your data. For this Section II of the book takes a closer look at dealing with strings (e.g. words or parts thereof), factors (e.g. categorical data) and dates and times (just as much of a challenge for seasoned users as it is for learners).<br/>In case we won't be able to finish this section we shall continue working through it during the next meetup.<\/p> <p>Location - we are meeting at the Curtin University Law School, 57 Murray Street.

    "description": "<p>About this meetup and prep before meetup:<\/p> <p>We will talk about the basics of version control with Git, and how this sometimes painful looking process can be made easy with RStudio and RStudio projects. This will be a repetition of a previous session, because this is a very crucial step for package development. So before we get into package dev, it would be nice to have these things set up first.<\/p> <p>Please bring your laptop and have R and RStudio installed and working.<br/>You can do everything we will do in this session on RStudio Cloud as well. But if you want to join us for a package development meetup later on you should have R, RStudio and Git installed on your computer. So we can connect these and it will be ready when the time comes for package dev. But if things don't work and you're having issues, don't worry! We're here to help (◕‿◕✿)<\/p> <p>Although anything you'll learn in this session can be used with any Git web repository, I'll mainly show examples via GitHub. If you don't have one yet please DON'T FORGET to create an account on <a href=\"https://github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/<\/a> -- it's free!<\/p> <p>Please make sure that you have git installed by typing<\/p> <p>git<\/p> <p>on your terminal and executing it. Git installation can be quite painful on Windows machines, but we will try to help you if you can't figure it out. If you're using a work laptop and don't have permissions to install things check with your IT department to make sure you can install all the software.<\/p> <p>Here are some introductory articles/links about Git:<br/><a href=\"https://medium.com/@garstep/osn-what-the-hell-is-git-6afbe634c4e8\" class=\"linkified\">https://medium.com/@garstep/osn-what-the-hell-is-git-6afbe634c4e8<\/a><br/><a href=\"http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\" class=\"linkified\">http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/<\/a><br/><a href=\"http://happygitwithr.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://happygitwithr.com/<\/a><br/><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial\" class=\"linkified\">https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial<\/a><\/p> <p>I would suggest looking at Installation chapter in happygitwithr if you have no idea how to install R, RStudio or Git: <a href=\"https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html<\/a><\/p> <p>We won't really have materials for this meetup, but I will ask you to potentially fork a repo from my github account: <a href=\"https://github.com/karaesmen/git_and_Rprojects\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/karaesmen/git_and_Rprojects<\/a><br/>You can find a quick readme in there too.<\/p> <p>As always pizza and soft drinks will be available courtesy of our great local supporter, the Columbus Collaboratory.<\/p> <p>Parking: Park in any spot marked \"Reserved for the Columbus Collaboratory\".

As one of several alternative approaches to forecasting future trends using past information, ARIMA is a flexible but also powerful ‘semi-parametric’ method for forecasting and fitting longitudinal (aka panel) data, and there is also a user-friendly R implementation. In contrast to more inferential tools like Cox survival models, ARIMA models can make useful, potentially more accurate forward predictions with relatively sparse datasets, and they can be very useful for surfacing initial evidence of causal trends for further validation.<\/p> <p>ARIMA can be used for everything from forecasting highly seasonal sales trends for food products, to the main example we’ll work through: surfacing a potential link between delayed discharges of hospitalised NHS patients and the unusual increase in English mortality rates since 2015.<\/p> <p>The workshop does not presuppose any prior experience with time series/panel data analysis, but it will be helpful to have some statistical background as well as basic R skills. Bring your laptops! Data and code will be circulated on Github.<\/p> <p>The talk will be given by Jules Shen, who is a statistical consultant with the Health Foundation, working primarily with the Improvement Analytics Unit. She is also a part-time PhD student in public health and policy at the LSHTM, who previously worked in development/health economics and management consultancy.

Mert ahhoz, hogy az adatot megtisztítsuk, tudnunk kell hol „piszkos” és milyen problémák vannak vele, az adatok transzformálása előtt pedig érdemes megismerni, hogy milyen értékekből tudunk dolgozni. A folyamat másik célja mintázatok, összefüggések megfigyelése az adathalmazban, amik mentén az elemzés későbbi lépéseiben tovább haladhatunk.<\/p> <p>Az anyag a 2019-es UseR! konferencián, Di Cook által tartott „Visualising High-Dimensional Data” című tutorial alapján állt össze. A workshopon röviden ismertetésre kerül az EDA története és fontosabb eszközei, ezután kódolás következik!<\/p> ",

She has been using her background in Statistics and Applied Mathematics to develop new bioinformatics methods for genomics data analysis.<\/p> <p>Göknur loves the functionality that R brings into her work. One of her favourite tools is Shiny, a tool that makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web applications with R (the official description of the Shiny package). Besides developing and maintaining R packages, with Shiny she builds interactive web applications to better communicate her work with her collaborators. In her talk, Göknur will help you build a mini interactive Shiny App and walk you through some common Shiny TRICKS that are frequently asked about. Therefore, her talk may be appealing to advanced shiny developers and newbies at the same time.<\/p> <p>Since we will be celebrating our third anniversary at this event, Göknur will also share with you our journey from her perspective. Stay with us until the end and join the celebration with some TREATS!<\/p> <p>Looking forward to seeing everyone there!<\/p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne<\/p> ",

We'll be hosting two speakers this evening to give us some insight into their work in R:<\/p> <p>Russ Hyde will be presenting on 'How to contribute to the R ecosystem/community'. Russ has been a bioinformatician at the University of Glasgow's Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre for the past 4 years, studying gene regulation in chronic myeloid leukaemia. R is his go-to tool for data analysis / visualisation / reporting, and he started coding in R about 10 years ago (alongside perl / python etc). Find him on twitter as @haematobot and on github as @russHyde.<\/p> <p>Martin Anderson will be walking us through his R work in ‘Using social network analysis in a realist evaluation of a recovery enterprise’<br/>– describing a procedure for collecting ego-network data using participatory mapping methods and using R to code and analyse this data. Martin is a PhD student at the Social and Public Health Sciences Unit. His PhD research is an evaluation of the implementation of the San Patrignano recovery enterprise model in Scotland, seeking to understand the influence of contextual factors on change mechanisms when transferring an intervention model to a substantially different setting.<\/p> <p>Come along to hear our two speakers.

The idea is to create programs that are easier for users to understand. But they are also easier for programmers to work on and maintain. In this talk, I will describe how data scientists can be inspired by this programming approach and start what I refer to as \"literate projecting.\" Literate projects are not only more pleasant to work on -- they are also easier for others to discover and explore. In my experiences as a researcher and now a data scientist at RStudio, I've had the pleasure to work on many literate projects, and I've felt the pain of working on illiterate ones too. What is the difference? What are the benefits? Based on my experiences, I'll share good literate projecting practices that have the potential to shift your mindset and reshape your workflow.<\/p> <p>Biography<\/p> <p>Alison Hill is a Data Scientist &amp; Professional Educator on the RStudio Education team, whose mission is to train the next million R users globally.

If, like me, you’ve got CPU time and no budget, running your own Shiny server is a compelling option. In this demo, we’ll take a clean Debian virtual machine, get Shiny Server up and running, add an Apache frontend, and throw in some LetsEncrypt for SSL goodness.

We're kicking off our first event in October, sponsored by trivago (<a href=\"https://www.trivago.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.trivago.com/<\/a>), with three short talks:<\/p> <p>• How to find, evaluate and launch data business ideas (Daniel Kupka)<br/>• Practical reproducibility of analyses (Alex Dolphin)<br/>• Shiny development in an academic vs business setting (Praer Owlarn)<\/p> <p>*** Agenda ***<br/>• 18:30 - 19:00: Arrive, get a drink and socialise<br/>• 19:00 - 19:10: Quick introduction<br/>• 19:10 - 19:30: Daniel's Talk + Q&amp;A<br/>• 19:30 - 19:50: Alex's Talk + Q&amp;A<br/>• 19:50 - 20:10: Praer's Talk + Q&amp;A<br/>• 20:10 - Open End: Socialising<\/p> <p>Please remember to bring your ID card - our security company requires it to provide you a guest badge!<\/p> <p>*** How to find, evaluate and launch data business ideas (Daniel Kupka) ***<\/p> <p>\"For every business advice, there is equally someone smart who says the opposite\" - Jason Cohen, Founder WPEngine.<br/>This is not going to be a lecture on the latest and hottest startup advice but rather a story on how I came up with my business idea, evaluated it´s potential using R and tested it with customers in real life.<\/p> <p>Daniel Kupka is an Economist by training and an entrepreneur at heart. After leaving his job at OECD without a plan, he tried various business models to pursue the \"entrepreneurial dream\" while freelancing on the side. But after much trial-and-error, FrontPage Data (<a href=\"https://frontpagedata.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://frontpagedata.com<\/a>), a Data Journalism on-Demand service, got some traction in the content marketing niche.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>*** Practical reproducibility of analyses (Alex Dolphin) ***<\/p> <p>In the pursuit of robust, reproducible, and extendable analyses, one key aspect frequently gets overlooked: practicality. Reproducible analyses with a potential for good review are often cumbersome to write: they may require branches to be pulled, environments to be built, and variables to be changed in a well-hidden file. I will propose a step towards greater practicality with an example using three technologies many data scientists know to some extent:<br/>- RMarkdown<br/>- R shiny server<br/>- Docker<\/p> <p>By presenting this concept I hope to demonstrate that it is possible for:<br/>- data scientists to review the live code with one link to a shiny-rendered page<br/>- non-data-scientists to rerun and extend the analysis through an intuitive GUI<br/>- the data scientist doing the task to achieve this only writing one file in their preferred coding language<\/p> <p>Alex Dolphin is a Data Scientist in the Marketplace Intelligence team of trivago. He has worked for 3 years in the Data Science function, and comes from a background of Mathematics at university. He believes that data scientists should have access to highly-reliable data and well-maintained tools as a minimum to produce quality output.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>*** Shiny development in an academic vs business setting (Praer Owlarn) ***<\/p> <p>Shiny is a popular R package for building interactive web apps – no web development knowledge required (<a href=\"https://shiny.rstudio.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://shiny.rstudio.com<\/a>)! Its ease-of-use and extendibility makes it popular in both academic and business settings, but implementation in the two environments can be rather different. I’ll share my experience writing shiny apps at a Max Planck Institute (a non-profit research institute) and trivago (a German hotel search engine), and how differences in task complexity, IT infrastructure and organisational mindset affected my approaches and the packages I used.<\/p> <p>Praer Owlarn is a data analyst at trivago. After a decade as a biologist, she decided to learn a little R and immediately fell in love! Soon, she waved goodbye to the bench and is now having fun diving into big data sets, exploring/contributing to R packages and building shiny apps.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Thanks to trivago for hosting &amp; sponsoring this edition of the Düsseldorf R User Group Meetup.

Her first book is a revelatory treatise on plant life—but it is also so much more.<\/p> <p>Lab Girl is a book about work, love, and the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together. It is told through Jahren’s stories: about her childhood in rural Minnesota with an uncompromising mother and a father who encouraged hours of play in his classroom’s labs; about how she found a sanctuary in science, and learned to perform lab work done “with both the heart and the hands”; and about the inevitable disappointments, but also the triumphs and exhilarating discoveries, of scientific work.<\/p> <p>Yet at the core of this book is the story of a relationship Jahren forged with a brilliant, wounded man named Bill, who becomes her lab partner and best friend. Their sometimes rogue adventures in science take them from the Midwest across the United States and back again, over the Atlantic to the ever-light skies of the North Pole and to tropical Hawaii, where she and her lab currently make their home.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

This session will introduce you to some of the most powerful and popular data manipulation techniques available in the tidyverse, primarily from the package dplyr, and is appropriate to coders with either no previous experience in R or a basic understanding of R principles. You’ll leave this session with an understanding of tidy data principles and how they can be applied to data preparation and wrangling.<\/p> <p>For more advanced useRs, we ask that you either assist other attendees with their learning or use the time while we teach to perform some data analysis and visualization (preferably using tidyverse!) on a dataset we will provide.<\/p> <p>We will plan for about an hour of instruction, and the rest of the time for networking and questions!<\/p> <p>A massive thank you to Kate Hertweck from Fred Hutch to put this class together!<\/p> ",

    "start": "2019-10-10",
    "description": "<p>What will we cover in this hands-on workshop?<br/>To get data into R, the first step is to import it. It’s very common to get data from databases, csv files, Excel files, APIs, or from websites through HTML tables. One less common but tricky way to get data is from PDFs. PDFs come in 2 forms - machine readable and non-machine readable. Dr. Stephanie Zimmer will give examples of both and discuss some tricks and tips she's learned to get these data into R so they can be analyzed. The bulk of the work will be done by two packages: pdftools and tesseract. We will also use the tidyverse package to parse data once it's in R.<\/p> <p>What's the schedule?<br/>6:00pm - 6:15pm - Networking<br/>6:15pm - 6:35pm - Lightning Talks* (Karen Jin et al. &amp; Margaret Reed et al.)<br/>6:35pm - 6:45pm - Set up (install R packages, etc.)<br/>6:45pm - 7:45pm - Workshop<br/>7:45pm - 8:00pm - Wrap up<\/p> <p>*We are looking for Lightning Talk presenters! Please email Sheila at [masked] or message her on Meetup if you are interested in giving a five minute Lightning Talk.<\/p> <p>What should I bring?<br/>Please bring your own (fully charged) laptop.<\/p> <p>What about parking?<br/>The best place to park for this event is the Bryan Center Garage on Science Drive. It is $1 for 30 minutes.<\/p> <p>Who should come?<br/>Beginners are welcome and encouraged to join this event but please install the most recent version of R as well as RStudio on your laptop before attending this meetup event. Experienced R users are also encouraged to update their versions of R and RStudio as well as their R packages (in RStudio go to Tools &gt; Check for package updates...). Here are links to free downloads for R (<a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://cran.r-project.org/<\/a>) and RStudio (<a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download<\/a>). Downloading and installing both of these programs before this meetup will help us keep on schedule and make sure you learn the most you can while at the meetup event.<\/p> <p>All events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.<\/p> ",

But is this ideal? How can we teach/learn/internalize ggplot and maybe get away from this copy/paste approach? Using some “slow ggplot” principles might help. The approach emphasizes incrementalism, clarity, and aesthetic mapping; and it deemphasizes geoms. While verbose and a little unorthodox, slow ggplotting might assist more users unlock the power of ggplot2. A short demo using this approach will be part of the talk. And we can of course discuss --- feedback on these ideas will certainly be welcome.<\/p> <p>Please feel free to pass along this announcement to more “RLadies”.

Depois de escrever todo o código e montar o seu dashboard, porém, vem o desafio de torná-lo acessível a outras pessoas dentro e fora da sua organização.

No entanto, ao longo dos anos, muitos recursos e pacotes foram adicionados, oferecendo aos usuários mais ferramentas para criar ambientes inteiros. Um exemplo disso é o pacote Shiny: um framework para construir aplicações web usando o R. As aplicações Shiny são uma forma poderosa e fácil de compartilhar e comunicar sua análise e permitir que as pessoas interajam com ela. Na In Loco, temos uma série de aplicações construídas usando tal framework, tanto para clientes externos quanto internos. Nessa palestra vamos compartilhar os desafios e soluções aplicadas durante o desenvolvimento.<\/p> <p>*Bio do Palestrante<br/>Gabriel Teotonio é graduando em Estatística da UFPE e cientista de dados na In Loco (Location Intelligence). Atualmente trabalha com localização de dados para campanhas de mídia Out of Home, desenvolvendo classificações, algoritmos estatísticos e aplicações em Shiny para os produtos de dados. Interesses de pesquisa incluem: modelos de regressão, métodos de ordem superior para estatística inferencial e análise estatística de formas<\/p> <p>_____________________________________________<br/>Sobre o CONRE-3<\/p> <p>* O grupo \"C3 Estatística e Ciência de Dados\" é uma iniciativa promovida pelo Conselho Regional de Estatística da 3ª Região (CONRE-3), buscando estimular a discussão sobre aplicações da análise de dados nos mais diversos contextos e áreas do conhecimento. Se você tem o espírito curioso e a mente aberta para descobrir como uma boa análise pode revelar padrões que desafiam o senso comum, venha trocar uma ideia com a gente! Aqui você vai encontrar uma galera que entende quanto tempo leva para arrumar o banco de dados, deixar aquele gráfico cheio de estilo, selecionar o modelo mais adequado... #tamojunto :-)<\/p> <p>Saiba mais em:<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/C3-Estatistica-e-Ciencia-de-dados/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/C3-Estatistica-e-Ciencia-de-dados/<\/a><\/p> <p>_____________________________________________<br/>Sobre as R-Ladies<\/p> <p>* R-Ladies é uma organização que promove a diversidade de gênero na comunidade da linguagem R. Nosso principal objetivo é promover a linguagem computacional estatística R compartilhando conhecimento, assim, quem tiver interesse na linguagem será bem-vinda, independente do nível de conhecimento. Nosso principal público-alvo são as pessoas que se identificam com o gênero feminino, portanto, mulheres cis, mulheres trans, bem como pessoas não-binárias e queer.<\/p> <p>* Importante saber:<br/>Código de Conduta (disponível aqui: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a>)<br/>Qualquer pessoa que violar ou houver previamente violado o código de conduta desta comunidade terá sua entrada proibida, será expulsa/o e/ou estará sujeita/o à ação que a pessoa organizadora achar mais apropriada, independente de inscrição no evento, ser membro do MeetUp ou qualquer outra condição.<\/p> <p>Saiba mais em:<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/rladies-sao-paulo/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/rladies-sao-paulo/<\/a><\/p> <p>_____________________________________________<br/>O evento é gratuito, mas as vagas são limitadas, seja consciente, e só se inscreva se puder comparecer no evento.<\/p> ",

    "title": "R-Ladies New York: Using R to Make Psychological Scales and Data Dictionaries",
    "group": "R-Ladies New York",
    "start": "2019-10-22",
    "description": "<p>**Meeting location: 55 Washington St, Brooklyn, NY, Floor 8**<\/p> <p>Our speakers for the night will be Emily H Ho from Fordham and Samuel Crane from Amplify. Emily will be talking about working with psychological scales in R. Samuel will be talking about building a data dictionary using blogdown.<\/p> <p>Speakers:<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30-6:45 pm Introductions and Social<br/>6:45-6:55 pm R-Ladies New York Announcements<br/>6:55-7:25 pm Developing and Validating a Psychological Scale in R<br/>7:25-7:55 pm Amplify, Blogdown and the Central Source of Truth<br/>7:55-8:00 pm Community Announcements<br/>8:00-8:30 pm Networking<\/p> <p>Title: Developing and Validating a Psychological Scale in R<\/p> <p>Abstract: If you've ever taken a personality quiz online or a career assessment at school (or that high-stakes college admissions test which shall not be named), you've come into contact with a validated scale. Using a recently developed scale as an example, I will walk through the process of how to create such a measure, from generating items to seeing the latent relationships between the items, testing for validity, and finally, how to ensure that the scale works 'in the wild'.<\/p> <p>Bio: Emily H Ho is a behavioral scientist pursuing her PhD in psychometrics and quantitative psychology at Fordham. Her work develops and applies new methods to improve decision-making in areas like health, climate change, and intelligence analysis. She has previously worked at The College Board conducting analyses on test validity and reliability. Follow her on Twitter at @emilyhho.<\/p> <p>Title: Amplify, Blogdown and the Central Source of Truth<\/p> <p>Abstract: Having a central source of truth for all data descriptions is critical to the development of data literacy within an organization, but data dictionaries are tricky to maintain. This talk will discuss how I am solving this problem at Amplify by using R to develop a website with blogdown and then leveraging the Looker API and a custom metadata store to deliver comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date information about our data.<\/p> <p>Bio: Samuel is the Director of Data Science at Amplify, an educational technology company based in Brooklyn, NY. He leads a team of data scientists focusing on analytics, algorithm development, and measuring the impact of Amplify’s curricula and assessments. Samuel is interested in statistical programming, reproducible research, data visualization, and the role of data in product development. Formerly a biologist and now a manager and data scientist, he loves to chat about building teams, the transition from academia to industry, beetles (his former obsession), and collecting wine.<\/p> ",

It is a weekend-long event on Nov 09 and 10th.<\/p> <p>**********************<br/>You can purchase tickets on eventbrite.<br/><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/hackathon-2019-11\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/hackathon-2019-11<\/a><br/>**********************<\/p> <p>This is the first Orange Country R Users Group (OCRUG) data science hackathon. During this event, we will be exploring an interesting data set, starting from the raw data all the way through to a final \"end product\" (e.g. a data visualization, an interesting data insight, a predictive model, etc.).<\/p> <p>This event is open to all experience levels, from the complete beginner to the highly experienced. Participants will work in teams to \"hack\" through the data and will present their work at the end of the event for prizes. You are free to create your own team, or we will assist in team creation if you do not have one. This is a great way to network, share, and learn from others.<\/p> <p>The main goal of the hackathon is to promote team work and foster education and learning in a welcoming environment. Though teams will competing to present their best work at the end of the event for prizes, communication and providing assistance across teams is highly encouraged. We will provide in-person training during the hackathon and online training prior to the event.<\/p> <p>Participants will need to bring their own computers during the event.<\/p> <p>We have set up a GitHub repository that has more information about the hackathon. Such as the schedule; setting up slack and much more. Further information will be provided prior to the event.<\/p> <p>Your ticket includes meals, snacks and drinks during the event. Optionally, parking at UCI is $10 per day.<\/p> <p>All participants must abide by the OCRUG Code of Conduct and R Consortium Code of Conduct.<\/p> <p>Your ticket includes meals, snacks and drinks during the event.

    "start": "2019-11-19",
    "description": "<p>**Note, this month our meetup will be a week earlier to accommodate the Thanksgiving week**<\/p> <p># Introduction<\/p> <p>This month we are lucky to have two of our seasoned speakers presenting. Alan, from RStudio, will give his much-anticipated talk on integrating React.js with Shiny. The reactR package has been updated to allow you to integrate with htmlwidgets and access all the React components. Emil will talk about his experience integrating the textrecipes into an ecosystem of packages and the lessons that he has learnt. This is becoming increasingly more important as the number of packages grows and so does the complexity of the analysis pipeline.<\/p> <p>Come early, network, enjoy the food and talks.<\/p> <p># Schedule<br/>6:30 - 6:50 Networking<br/>6:50 - 7:00 Welcome &amp; general announcement<br/>7:00 - 7:30 Integrating React.js and Shiny<br/>7:30 - 8:00 Snakes in the Studio: Adding Python to your R Workflow<br/>8:00 - Raffle<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Networking and Clean-up<\/p> <p># Talk 1<\/p> <p>## Title: Integrating React.js and Shiny<br/>## Speaker: Alan Dipert<br/>## Abstract<br/>React.js is a thriving JavaScript library that eases encapsulating and sharing sophisticated component libraries. The React.js ecosystem is filled with components for doing everything from color selection (react-color) to animation (react-spring). While it's always been technically possible to integrate React.js components with Shiny applications, it hasn't always been particularly obvious how. To make it easier, we augmented the excellent reactR package with functions specifically designed to make it easier to create new htmlwidgets, inputs, and outputs based on React.js components. In this talk, I will further motivate and demonstrate these new tools and do my best to empower the audience to try them out.<\/p> <p># Talk 2<\/p> <p>## Title: Building a package that fits into an evolving ecosystem<br/>## Speaker: Emil Hvitfeldt<br/>## Abstract<br/>With an ever-increasing amount of textual data is available to us, having a well-thought-out toolchain for modelling is crucial. tidymodels is a recent effort to create a modelling framework that shares the underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures of the tidyverse. textrecipes joined the roster a year ago and provided an exciting bridge to text preprocessing. This talk tells the tale of the package textrecipes; starting with the Github issue that sparked the idea for the package, go over the trials and challenges associated with building a package that heavily integrates with other packages all the way to the release on CRAN.<\/p> ",

They might seem overwhelming for those who never tried to use them, however, the truth is that the basic theory behind it is not that hard to understand. You might be surprised that the simplest neural network is just a linear function. You also might be surprised that learning how to create a Deep Learning model does not require a PhD in math related subject.<\/p> <p>With recent frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras the effort needed to build a DNN is similar to the effort needed to build any other Machine Learning model.<\/p> <p>On this practice oriented workshop you will learn the basics of how DNN work and you will implement a simple one by yourself using the Keras framework in R. We will work on a very simple, yet real world example to showcase the mechanics that powers Deep Learning. We will predict the rent price of an apartment based on its characteristics using the publicly available data originating from AirBnb.<\/p> <p>The instructors Mikołaj Olszewski and Mikołaj Bogucki are both experienced Data Scientists and the founders of idash.pl, a startup which provides Data Science training.

Yuan Lab<br/>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute<\/p> <p>Giotto, a pipeline for integrative analysis and visualization of single-cell spatial transcriptomic data<\/p> <p>The rapid development of novel spatial transcriptomics technologies has provided new opportunities to investigate the interactions between cells and their native microenvironment. However, effective use of such technologies requires the development of innovative computational algorithms and pipelines. Here we present Giotto, a comprehensive, flexible, robust, and open-source pipeline for spatial transcriptomic data analysis and visualization. The data analysis module implements a wide range of algorithms ranging from basic tasks such as data pre-processing to innovative approaches for cell-cell interaction characterization. The data visualization module provides a user-friendly workspace that allows users to interactively visualize, explore and compare multiple layers of information. These two modules can be used iteratively for refined analysis and hypothesis development. We illustrate the functionalities of Giotto by using the recently published seqFISH+ dataset for mouse brain. Our analysis highlights the utility of Giotto for characterizing tissue spatial organization as well as for the interactive exploration of multi- layer information in spatial transcriptomic and imaging data. We find that single-cell resolution spatial information is essential for the investigation of ligand-receptor mediated cell-cell interactions. Giotto is generally applicable and can be easily integrated with external software packages for multi-omic data integration.<\/p> <p>Article: <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/701680v1\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/701680v1<\/a><\/p> ",

One of these dependencies exists between departing aircraft in southerly direction on runway 16 and arriving traffic from the north on runway 14. Because of this, and during times of high departure demand on runway 16, the arrival flow is regulated by the air navigation service provider. These regulations allow for departures on runway 16 to take off without congesting the airspace with arriving aircraft. However, for such a regulation to be effective, it must be set in place well in advance, in fact before aircraft actually have departed at their origin. Therefore, a reliable estimate on expected departure demand on runway 16 a couple of hours ahead highly supports the decision whether regulations are necessary or not.<\/p> <p>We present several models to predict the departing runway for aircrafts in order to support the air navigation service provider with this decision. The latest of these models incorporates data from different sources like flight plan and weather model data and resulted in a classification tree model which can predict the runway with high accuracy. Besides insight on the steps undertaken for building the model, we also provide an outlook on how such models can help to improve operations at Zurich airport in the future.<\/p> <p>--<\/p> <p>Speaker 2: Joao Banha | Business Analyst @ Swiss International Air Lines<\/p> <p>Title: NOTAM message classifier<\/p> <p>A notice to airmen (NOTAM) is a semi-encoded message to alert personnel and systems concerned with flight operations of potential hazards along a flight route. Each year over 1 million NOTAM messages are issued worldwide and this number is growing. The messages contain crucial information for pilots, yet their number poses an increasing operational challenge, when messages have to be processed and classified manually.<br/>We created a machine learning binary classifier in R to deal with this challenge. This classifier provides a recommendation on the overall importance of these messages. Exploring the data resulted in the conclusion that a large fraction of messages can be automatically classified with high confidence. R Shiny is also used for the visualization of results.<\/p> ",

Instead of forcing standard linear models on every question we have, you could instead use generalized additive models. These models are very flexible and can be used to model and test a wide range of relationships, without prior knowledge of the exact relationship between the variables. In this workshop, we will guide you through formulating, checking and interpreting simple GAMs. We show you how to plot model smooths and prediction, and discuss possibilities to extend these models.<\/p> <p>We will live-code while going through the examples, so we encourage everyone to bring their laptops to follow along. It is best if you have R, Rstudio, and the packages “mgcv” and “tidyverse” installed. As always, these workshops are free of charge and open for everyone to attend!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>By: Alexander Mueller<\/p> <p>There is a lot of conversation out there about “big” data and rarely is it mentioned just how it is big. There are at least two ways: your data might be “long” by having many rows, and / or it might be “thick” by having many columns. This presentation will focus on modeling challenges presented by thick data.<\/p> <p>We will start by discussing some example thick datasets and examine the problems they create for standard modeling techniques like linear regression. I will spend a little bit of time giving some heuristic arguments covering the mathematical reasons why thick datasets can produce bad behavior and then transition into some discussion of which algorithms can be expected to behave well and why. Random forest algorithms and regularized linear regression algorithms like LASSO will be discussed in particular.<\/p> <p>We will then use R to apply these more robust algorithms to our original thick dataset, examine and compare results, and use this information to fuel some general conversation about how to approach thick datasets in general.<\/p> <p>The meetup will be in The Showroom in the CIC building at 20 South Sarah Street, St. Louis, MO 63108.

This is roughly my motto of continuous improvement and I'd like to share with the MelbURN community, a collection of learnings that I have acquired over the past few years. Whether it is following the DRY principle, or vowing to never write a for loop again, or learning to prepare recipes and bake them in R, a lot of things I have learnt have made me feel a lot better about how problems are tackled. Unlike other talks where you might learn about a particular package or technique, this talk will introduce you to some of the ways in which you can think about and be better at writing R code.<\/p> <p>Kaushik Lakshman is a data scientist and a massive fan of R. He works at Betfair where he uses R to analyse the incredibly rich and extensive betting exchange data, to create data products and create business value using data science. Outside of work he loves to have a go at building sports prediction models with the hope that one day it will help him retire at the beach (but has so far been very unsuccessful)!<\/p> <p>Second presentation: Getting your colleagues started with R<\/p> <p>R is fantastic piece of software which is widely used in academia and commercial sector – if you are coming to this talk then you are likely already a fan. In this presentation Lyndon will draw on his experience of teaching R to hundreds of academics and business professionals (and thousands of students) to discuss tips, tricks, and things to consider when introducing and teaching your colleagues how to use R. This will include different approaches to teaching and supporting colleagues, some useful tools and resources, and the different needs and support that your colleagues may require.<\/p> <p>Dr Lyndon Walker is a former statistics lecturer who is now a part-time statistician for SACS Consulting - a psychometrics and organisational psychology company, founder of Veritate Data Science - an education and statistics training consultancy, and investor/advisor to Preventure - a workplace safety wearable tech startup.

    "start": "2019-11-20",
    "description": "<p>Three speakers are contributing to our meetup in November. Doors will open at 5:30PM where members can enjoy pizza, soda, and networking. The first talk will begin at 6:00PM.<\/p> <p>Talk 1: Rig State Detection by David Shakleton -- Over the past two or three years Independent Data Services (IDS) have shifted from ‘proof of concept’ projects to global live rollouts of their in-time (near real-time) lean automated reporting (LAR) and drilling performance monitoring (DPM) services. Some of our projects begin their lives in R, as RStudio and Shiny apps lend themselves beautifully to the rapid prototyping of ideas - by being able to ingest large amounts of data, and perform analytics accessed through an easily-adjustable user interface. The first step to realizing these automated reporting &amp; analytics services in the upstream oil &amp; gas industry is 'rig state detection' - a process where data is taken from key sensors on the rig and run through logic-based and/or machine learning algorithms to determine what the rig, drill string, etc., are doing. Rig states are then used to build activity descriptions for daily reporting, and generate charts and dashboards for key drilling parameters, with web-based charts and dashboards available from anywhere, any device within moments of the event. IDS have made further strides to automate daily operational reporting by automatically ingesting pdf/Excel/WITSML/etc. data to auto-populate much of the daily report.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Model Agnostic Approach by Alastair Muir -- The real value of Machine Learning to businesses is when it is used to create a deep understanding of the problem. The predictive power of modern machine learning algorithms comes at the cost of decreased transparency. This is why Black Box solutions, however accurate, are not immediately accepted by themselves. You should come away from this session with a toolkit you can use to probe and understand your models. This could be for regulatory requirements, change management resistance, or just general acceptance. We will be using a typical example of a non-linear process modeled using different traditional statistical and deep learning models. So, we are going with the “model agnostic” approach.<\/p> <p>Talk 3: Asset Failure Susceptibility Ranking, using LambdaMART, by Busayo Akinloye -- The electric distribution system is one of the most diverse systems in the electrical grid. It consists of both overhead and underground assets. Growing power quality and reliability expectations from regulatory authorities and customers demand minimal downtime of equipment. Metrics such as System Average Interruption Frequency Index, and System Average Interruption Duration Index are closely being monitored by electric utilities and form a major part of the business’ performance indices. These growing expectations, coupled with aging assets and budget constraints require innovative and cost-effective ways to realize actionable intelligence in order to optimize spending, while improving or maintaining the quality and reliability of the electric grid. Data analysis offers a unique solution that is reproducible across all asset infrastructure of an electric grid. It employs complex machine learning and statistical algorithms to extract actionable insights and learnings from historical data. These insights will help utilities better allocate both financial and human resources to the most failure susceptible assets, truly making data-driven decisions. I will discuss the development of an asset failure susceptibility ranking system on the Calgary area Underground Residential Distribution System. This system employs the supervised ranking system used by information retrieval systems. The framework of this ranking system can be applied to all distribution system assets, due to the reproducible nature of the statistical algorithms it employs.<\/p> <p>This event is supported by the Pacific Institutes of the Mathematical Sciences and the Cenovus Energy.<\/p> ",

While the common heatmap allows us to gain a global view of count data such as gene expression or metabolomic data, it can also be helpful to isolate select observations for visualization in individual plots. This talk will demonstrate automated plotting of gene expression data for each gene in a cellular pathway using a time course dataset. The data visualization package ggplot2 will be used and the function tryCatch() will be implemented to handle possible errors.<\/p> <p># Schedule<br/>Thursday, November 14th, 6:30-8:30pm<br/>6:30 - Check-in and Networking<br/>7:00 - Announcements<br/>7:15 - Data Visualization of Gene Expression Data<br/>8:30 - Meeting Adjourned<\/p> <p># Parking<br/>- Parking is free and in the back of the building or on the street.<\/p> <p># Technology<br/>- Extension cords and outlet strips will be provided to power your devices.<br/>- Free WiFi will also be provided, and the username/pass will be posted throughout the venue.<br/>- Slides will be sent out and posted on our GitHub after the event.<\/p> <p># Food &amp; Freebies<br/>- Healthy snacks and water will be provided.<br/>- Free R-Ladies, tidyverse, NASA, and Microsoft Developer Advocates stickers will also be given out.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>The second RGlasgow meetup is upon us! As with the first meetup, we'll be hosting two speakers to give us some insight into their work in R, and this time we'll also trial a five-minute \"agony aunt\" session at the end- if anyone has come up against a brick wall with a problem they're trying to solve this is your chance to put that to the group (which may in itself prove therapeutic). If you'd like a guaranteed one-minute slot email one of the organisers, if there's time we'll also welcome on-the-night queries. Now, to our two speakers!:<\/p> <p>Mirjam Allik will be presenting her work “Writing R functions: changing existing functions to get what you want\". While there is a function for almost anything in R, at times the behaviour of these is not exactly what you would wish. Rather than writing a completely new function tailored to your needs, it is sometimes possible to edit or “be inspired” by the source code of another function performing similar tasks. We will look at the useful function na.locf (last observation carried over) from the zoo package and see how this can be altered to infer missing values.<\/p> <p>Nicola McGuire will be delivering a presentation on \"Conducting meta analysis in R using individual participant level data\". Nicola is a 3rd year PhD student investigating the relationship between negative symptoms (difficulties with motivation, social engagement experiencing pleasure, and displaying emotions), and metacognition - our ability to understand ourselves and the world around us. She will discuss how she conducted a meta-analysis in R of existing data investigating the relationship between these two constructs and the additional benefits and possibilities realised by obtaining unique participant data from these studies. Nicola will also discuss some of the challenges in completing a meta-analysis and lessons learned. On twitter as: @nicolamcguire_.<\/p> <p>Come along to hear our two speakers and air any R woes. Afterwards we'll head to the Howlin' Wolf for post-meetup catchup!<\/p> <p>Please arrive between 1715 and 1730, there will be a rep at the main entrance where you sign in, and one on the top floor to let you in the Unit. Due to the security at the building we can't guarantee anyone arriving after 1730 will be able to gain access to the meetup, but if you're running late message Fiona Christie.<\/p> ",

What are the challenges? Branden Collingsworth, Aurora Cooperative's Director of Data Science, will show how R can be used to deploy static web pages, dashboards, dynamic web applications, APIs, ETL and batch scoring jobs while dealing with the common challenges that arise when users depend on your code.<\/p> <p>* R in Production, Part II: Aurora Cooperative's Environment (feat. Docker)<br/>Kelly Pook<\/p> <p>What does it actually take to put R in production? Picking up from Part One of this presentation, Kelly Pook from Aurora Cooperative will walk through their team's environment, including an overview of how Docker and containerization address many of the persistent challenges analytics teams have in deploying their code. She will also cover other open-source tools and workflows that make up a production-ready R environment -- from development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.<\/p> <p>* An R Package for Life Actuarial Assumptions<br/>Matthew Caseres<\/p> <p>Actuaries need to supply assumptions to financial models.

With this popularity comes more and more people vying for entry-level data science jobs. How can you stand out from the crowd and actually land your first job as a data scientist?<\/p> <p>Fortunately, our speaker, Emily Robinson, is writing a book, “Build a Career in Data Science,” on that very topic. Along with her co-author Jacqueline Nolis, she covers all of the non-technical skills you need to get and succeed in your first data science jobs. (<a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science<\/a>)<\/p> <p>In this talk, Emily will cover what skills you need to start your career, the different types of data scientist jobs, and how to best position yourself based on your academic and work history. She’ll show you how to make not only a standout resume and cover letter but also a strong data science portfolio of projects and blog posts. If you’ve been struggling to break into the field or are even just curious about what the data science hype is all about, this talk is for you.<\/p> ",

The data.table package offers a very fast tabular data object and a suite of functions that can satisfy many of the data processing requirements an analyst will encounter. The syntax is very similar to operating on base R's data.frame object, so it is relatively quick to learn for those used to working with data.frame. Programming with the data.table package can produce terse, elegant code. Those who prefer doing more with less typing will appreciate the workflow.<\/p> <p>In short, data.table is quick to learn, quick to type, and offers some of the most performant tabular data operations found in R. We hope you will join us!<\/p> <p>Author Bio:<\/p> <p>Jason Taylor has been using R professionally since 2011, and has previously given talks and workshops on programming in R and Python.

This workshop is designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. You'll learn holistic workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis.<\/p> <p>You should take this workshop if: you've been using R for a while and you feel like writing R code is not what's holding you back the most. You've realized that you have more pressing \"meta\" problems that no one seems to talk about: You want to know how to divide your work into projects and scripts and how to share your work with others.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>摘要:<br/>深度學習在數據擬合是很有力的工具, 盡管有需要大量訓練資料以及缺乏解釋性等問題, 還是被用在許多領域。 而在工程科學領域, 經常將問題用微分方程表示, 並且在許多現實問題都有成熟的應用, 通常具有可解釋性與只需要少量資料就能建模等優點，但是當問題變複雜, 數學推導起來就頗吃力。因此用深度學習協助微分方程來對工程科學問題建模, 能結合兩邊優點, 並且能用上工程科學領域多年累積的知識。<\/p> <p>這次分享會概略介紹如何將深度學習的向前推論看成是解微分方程問題，而反向傳播則看成是最佳控制問題, 離散時間與連續時間版本都會介紹一下, 然後用平衡車與登月太空船等例子, 解釋如何將深度神經網路混合微分方程來建模, 有時間會再與增強學習的控制模型做個比較。<\/p> <p>講者:<br/>Jiawei<\/p> ",

We will work with both English and Chinese data. Hopefully, I can convince you that quanteda’s “ugly way” is better than the “tidy way”, when we are talking about text mining. Please bring your laptop if you want to follow along!<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Dr Chung-hong Chan is a postdoctoral researcher at the Mannheim Center for European Social Research, University of Mannheim.

La naturaleza de bajo costo y de fin de semana del evento significa que es accesible para una amplia gama de personas que de otra manera no podrían asistir.<br/>La idea es que el aprendizaje sobre R sea accesible y local, nuestro enfoque está en llevar R a las personas en lugar de hacer que las personas vayan a R. Esto ayuda a construir una comunidad local diversa y creciente de usuarios de R.<\/p> ",

Hence, there is often a conflict between accuracy and interpretability. We want the most accurate models but don’t want to sacrifice interpretability. In this talk, I discuss this conflict and some new methods in Machine Learning for interpreting ANY predictive model so you do not have to sacrifice predictive accuracy. A package (<a href=\"https://github.com/mt-edwards/xrayspecs\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/mt-edwards/xrayspecs<\/a>) is also introduced that provides these new methods for R programmers.<\/p> <p>Bayesian statistics in astrophysics.<\/p> <p>I introduce Bayesian statistics and compare with the frequentist approach. I motivate a Bayesian framework. I introduce sunspots and why we care about them. I perform a case study fitting an AR(1) (first a normal and then a negative binomial) model to data of occurrences of sunspots.<\/p> ",
