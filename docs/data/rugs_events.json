    "description": "<p>Talk 1:<br/>Speaker: Daniel Jacobs (@djacobs7), Senior Director, Data Science Engineering at Age Of Learning. Website: www.dontyouremember.com<\/p> <p>Title: Getting better at R By Learning More Packages More Deeply<\/p> <p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Learning R means learning dozens of different packages and methods. CRAN has over 10,000 packages, and it's not always clear what's important to learn next. Once you decide what to learn, it's can be difficult to commit the important methods to memory so that you can use them easily over the next weeks or months. This talk walks you through strategies for deciding what to learn, and then committing them to memory with the spaced repetition algorithm. It gives an example of discovering what packages to learn via code analysis. Finally, it describes the development of the remembR package, which lets you study R directly in R.<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Emil Hvitfeldt (@Emil_Hvitfeldt), Research Programmer at USC and Co-organizer of @laeRusers<\/p> <p>Title: Hyper-parameter Tuning with Tune Package<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Many statistical and machine learning models have parameters that can directly be inferred from the data. The newly released tune package is part of the tidymodels framework and allows you to do hyper-parameter tuning.<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>Timeline:<br/>6:30: Socializing<br/>7:00-8:00: Talks<br/>8:00: Socializing<\/p> <p>Address:<br/>Room 115/116<br/>USC<br/>2001 N.

After a quick intro<br/>to machine learning and the GBM algorithm, I will show how easy it is to<br/>train and then use GBMs in real-life business applications using some<br/>the most popular open source implementations (xgboost, lightgbm and<br/>h2o). We’ll do all this in both R and Python with only a few lines of<br/>code and this talk will be accessible for a wide audience (with limited<br/>prior knowledge of machine learning). Finally, in the last part of the<br/>talk I will provide plenty of references that can get you to the next<br/>level. GBMs are a powerful technique to have in your machine learning<br/>toolbox, because despite all the latest hype about deep learning (neural<br/>nets) and “AI”, in fact GBMs usually outperform neural networks on<br/>structured/tabular data most often encountered in business applications.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Szilard studied Physics in the 90s and obtained a PhD by using statistical methods to analyze the risk of financial portfolios. He worked in finance, then more than a decade ago moved to become the Chief Scientist of a tech company in Santa Monica doing everything data (analysis, modeling, data visualization, machine learning, data infrastructure etc). He is the founder/organizer of several meetups in the Los Angeles area (R, data science etc) and the data science community website datascience.la. He is the author of a well-known machine learning benchmark on github (1000+ stars), a frequent speaker at conferences (keynote/invited at KDD, R-finance, Crunch, eRum and contributed at useR!, PAW, EARL, H2O World, Data Science Pop-up, Dataworks Summit etc.), and he has developed and taught graduate data science and machine learning courses as a visiting professor at two universities (UCLA and CEU in Europe).<\/p> <p>Timeline:<\/p> <p>– 6:00pm arrival, snacks+drinks (non-alchoholic) and networking<br/>– 7:00pm talk start<\/p> <p>You must have a confirmed (\"Yes\") RSVP and please arrive by 6:55pm the latest.<\/p> <p>Venue:<br/>Core Digital Media<br/>12181 Bluff Creek Dr #250 · Playa Vista, CA<\/p> ",

Sometimes, though, you want all your interactive components to synchronize their outputs to user inputs instead of all acting independently. That’s exactly what the crosstalk package does. Carl Howe, RStudio’s Director of Education, will show attendees how to use the crosstalk package on RStudio Cloud, and each of you can try it out for yourselves. When Carl demonstrated this package during his R Markdown and Interactive Dashboards workshop, many of the attendees said this one package was worth the entire price of the workshop; we think you’ll find it worth knowing about.<\/p> <p>Carl and Rachael Dempsey will also recap the highlights of rstudio::conf 2020 held in San Francisco on January 27-30, 2020, and they’ll provide links to the conference content so that you can download many of the materials yourselves.<\/p> <p>#2<br/>Building Simple Equity Momentum Strategy with R<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Al Yazdani, PhD, is the Machine Learning and Quantitative Research Manager at State Street Associates in Cambridge, MA. He leads a research group of data scientists tasked with the novel applications of data-driven methods in quantitative finance, particularly the applications of machine learning methods in risk and return strategies for FX and Equities portfolios. In his presentation, Al will demonstrate how to use R capabilities to develop simple yet effective Equities Momentum Investment strategies.<\/p> <p>Location:<br/>WeWork One Beacon Street<\/p> <p>WeWork is a community of creators.

    "description": "<p>By: Ehsan Jahanpour<\/p> <p>R was initially developed for data analysis and statistics in 1993. Since then, it has gained a lot of use from academia &amp; industry. The user-friendly &amp; open-source RStudio IDE made the programming language even more popular. Nowadays, there are a lot of applications, dashboards and APIs are developed in R using shiny, plotly, plumber and lot of other packages.<\/p> <p>However, as data size getting bigger and messier, we would need to use additional techniques and packages to improve the coding and pay more attention to how R interacts with our system resources. In this meetup, I will explain different programming techniques for reading in and searching through datasets as they get bigger. Also, I will discuss on how profiling can be useful in R to find the bottlenecks and pay attention to the part of the script that matters the most.<\/p> <p>As a meetup spoiler, I will use the “profvis” package for profiling and evaluating the performance of “read.table” vs “fread” for reading datasets and “for loops” vs “apply family” vs “foreach\" package for looping over objects.<\/p> ",

Whereas R has been increasingly used by data science communities. Biotech-Pharma can take many advantages of R, such as data visualization to analyze and present clinical trial data for decision making and regulatory submission. However per guidance, computerized systems used in clinical research in a regulatory setting must be validated, and validating R is extremely challenging because of the nature of an open source environment. This presentation will discuss the validation requirements per regulatory guidance for both system setup and application development. In addition, we will share our experience of building validated and non-validated R distributions at BioMarin, which include 1) the infrastructure of the R platform, and 2) key components of R validation process: the package management process, and package validation framework. Our exploratory work suggests that with an appropriate system infrastructure and process setup, validating R in the Biotech-Pharma industry is achievable.<\/p> <p>###########<br/>Doug KelKhoff<br/>Building Trust in Open Source Scientific Software: Grassroots Software Validation for R<\/p> <p>Many regulated industries are at a turning point in their adoption of open source tools. To stay competitive, these companies must make use of open source tooling, which often have the first or most well adopted implementations of novel methods. Likewise, as the tooling around open source development has improved, the tools have followed, to the point that most recent graduates have roots in open source languages and prioritize publishing methods with open source implementations. This form of software development is quite new to many regulated industries, and the decades-long processes that govern software validation are being strained to accommodate the influx of community code.<\/p> <p>I'll discuss ongoing work to build shared, cross-industry tooling for R package validation, how open source tools can be reproducibly delivered for regulators, and how these two pieces combine to provide a cross-industry mechanism to deliver reproducible results with.<\/p> <p>############<br/>Dan Putler<br/># Understanding Opioid Prescribing Behavior in England<\/p> <p>I make use of both the R spdep and splm packages, coupled with the Alteryx analytics platform, to develop a spatial panel model to examine the drivers of prescribing behavior for opioid analgesics on the part of general practice physicians in England, relying on data from the Office of National Statistics for England and Wales, the National Health Service of England, and the commercial data provider MB-Research.<\/p> <p>The analysis reveals that socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of an area play a major role in opioid prescription rates among physicians, which are consistent with Case and Deaton's findings of \"deaths of despair\" in the US. However, strong spatial dependence patterns are also at play, which indicate that there are systematic differences in physicians' willingness to prescribe opioids across England. This suggests that the traditional public health approach of providing regional physician training could be useful in lowering opioid prescription rates and related opioid overdose deaths.<\/p> ",

Online social media data provides researchers an unprecedented collection of digital human footprints that opens new possibilities to study these connections at a microscopic level. Recently, many studies tried to characterize different interplays between urban mobility patterns, socio-economic status and the social network of people from telecommunication or online social network data at the city level. In this work, we follow individuals in the 50 largest metropolitan areas of the United States through their messages sent on the online social networking site, Twitter. Focusing on users with frequent messages containing exact coordinates, we identify their possible home and work location inside cities. Additionally, we construct the social network of users based on mutual followership on the site and analyze how social relationships are formed depending on home and work locations in urban space.<\/p> <p>Our results suggest that the structure of individuals' social ties is sensitive to the income levels at their home and work locations. Residents of poor areas who commute to richer parts of a city travel more and tend to have a significantly lower degree in the social network than those who remain to work in the bottom 30% areas. Also, these users have a higher clustering of mutual followers in their ego network and a larger fraction of their friends concentrate geographically close to their home location. We thus discover fundamental patterns in social tie formation using only publicly available geolocated data combined with census information.<\/p> <p>Janosov Milán - Sztár DJ-k = sztár mentorok?<\/p> <p>Az előadás során betekintést nyújtok a legsikeresebb elektronikus zenei előadók kapcsolatrendszerébe és hálózatos mintáiba egy adat-alapú kutatás keretein belül.

I will talk about the R survey package, which just had its 16th birthday. The package allows for exploratory analysis and modelling, and supports research into more efficient estimation in two-phase samples.<\/p> <p>About Thomas:<br/>Thomas Lumley is originally from Australia, and was at the University of Washington in Seattle for 15 years. He is now Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Auckland. His research interests include study design in epidemiology, semiparametric theory, computing and graphics, and genomics. Thomas blogs about statistics in the media at statschat.org.nz and about other topics at notstatschat.rbind.io. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand and the American Statistical Association, and a member of R Core, and has taught short courses on R in thirteen time zones.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> ",

This week we will be exploring a recent Tidy Tuesday dataset. Tidy Tuesday is a weekly social data project in R organized by the R4DS Online Learning Community. Come try your hand at wrangling and making a beautiful figure from this dataset to share with us during the meeting, and/or bring your questions. Whether you are new to R or a data scientist, there will be an opportunity for everyone to learn something new. Our lightning talks this week will be presented by UCR's Office of Technology Partnerships (OTP) and they will talk about two exciting OTP programs!<\/p> <p>From the Tidy Tuesday website:<br/>\"Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. While the dataset will be 'tamed', it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community! As such we encourage everyone of all skills to participate!\"<\/p> <p>Since a wide range of skill levels are represented by our group :) we've decided to work with the NFL Stadium Attendance from early February as there's more community posted code for inspiration on twitter (check out #tidytuesday):<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-04/readme.md\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-04/readme.md<\/a><\/p> <p>Big thanks to UCR Library, UCR GradQuant, andUCR's Office of Technology Partnerships (OTP) supporting us and this event, and special thanks to our sponsor, The Blackstone LaunchPad powered by Techstars at UCR, for providing the pizza!<\/p> <p>See you there!!<\/p> ",

There are many questions one might wish to ask of such a tree, concerning the depth/breadth of the whole tree, or calculations across parts of it.<\/p> <p>Working with the trees is made possible in R via the `data.tree` library, and visualization can be done with `ggraph` extensions to ggplot2. In this talk, we'll cover how to create a tree object (say, from a data frame), how to calculate some properties on each part of the tree, and how to visualize the result.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Manipulating and visualizing weather data<br/>### Juliette Maire (<a href=\"https://www.sruc.ac.uk/jmaire\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sruc.ac.uk/jmaire<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Large-scale weather dataset (historical or predictions) is usually a \"big\" multidimensional dataset that includes space, time components and various variables such as rain, temperature, wind speed. Weather dataset is often saved as NetCDF file. This talk is a quick introduction to how to simply handle such files, extract or manipulate data from it, and visualize the results in R.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Abstract:<br/>Analysing complex sampling -- cluster samples, unequal probabilities, stratification -- used to be a separate and somewhat isolated area of statistics. Some books on the topic might have given the impression it was mostly about the care and feeding of subscripts. In fact, well-conducted complex sampling gives data with important differences from other data sources, but ones whose impact on the analysis is limited. Modern survey analysis software is aimed at reducing the differences to a minimum, so analysts and domain experts can analyse complex surveys correctly in most straightforward cases. I will talk about how you can use the R survey package to do most of the analyses you already do, but with data from complex surveys. ​<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Thomas Lumley is originally from Australia, but worked in Seattle, at the University of Washington, for 12 years.

Based on these use cases, he outlines the features of this package and discusses future development. The presentation will be interactive with live coding and a script that attendants can run during or after the presentation.

    "description": "<p>At this meetup we have an interesting presentation and training from Winston Saunders on data that is too large to fit into memory! We look forward to having you!<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>In 2019 the Washington Post successfully pursued a FOIA request for records of opiod shipments from the DEA's Automated Reporting System (ARCOS) spanning the height of the prescription opiod epidemic from 2006 to 2012. These data were subsequently published for 179 Million drug transactions ranging from mg to kilograms in size. While R's powerful analytical and visualization capabilities are, in principle, great for understanding the structure of the distribution network that enabled the epidemic, given the 78GB size of the dataset, efficient analysis required developing techniques, including data parsing and preparation of \"summary\" data sets, to dig deeply and thoroughly into the data. I'll share some of the techniques used to wrangle the raw data into more digestible summaries as well as the tools developed and the summaries themselves. We'll also explore how these summary data sets, coupled with mapping (ggmap), network analysis (network, igraph), and Shiny, can be used to reveal the magnitude the opiod epidemic and the network architecture, from manufacturer, to distributor, to consumer, that enabled it. To wrap up, we'll access one of the summary datasets and walk through a quick network visualization or mapping hands-on exercise. [To do the ggmaps mapping exercise you'll need your own API key from google]<\/p> <p>Biography:<br/>Winston is a data hackster with a day job. Though he first learned R in the Johns Hopkins Coursera pre-tidyverse he now enthusiastically embraces %&gt;% and, nine times in ten, chooses slice(1:10) over [1:10, ]. He’s explored ML, NLP, AI, image processing, web &amp; twitter bots, kaggle competitions, and lots of other applications in R. He selected his current project out of a balanced sense of responsibility and mischief.<\/p> <p>If you are wanting to have your own meetup to discuss the cool ways you are using R, reach out to Ellis Hughes via Meetup.com!<\/p> ",

C'est une méthode qui est basée sur deux algorithmes (SIMPLS ou NIPALS) qui peuvent être utilisés pour fournir les estimations des paramètres des modèles. La régression PLS est très efficace pour analyser les relations de cause à effet entre les variables réponses et les composantes. L'algorithme NIPALS fournit des estimations sur de données incomplètes sans imputation. Notre objectif est étudier l’influence de la proportion de données manquantes sur l’estimation du nombre de composantes dans une régression PLS pour une hypothèse MCAR.<\/p> ",

Jessica will be talking about the timetrackR app. Margie will be discussing the gtsummary package.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30-6:55 pm Introductions and Social Time<br/>6:55-7 pm R-Ladies New York Announcements<br/>7-7:10 Sponsor Message from IBM Developer New York<br/>7:10-7:40 It's Time to Shine with timetrackR App, Jessica Lavery<br/>7:40-8:10 Creating publication-ready and reproducible analytical tables with gtsummary, Margie Hannum<br/>8:10-8:30 Networking<\/p> <p>Title: It’s Time to Shine with the timetrackR App<br/>Presenter: Jessica Lavery<\/p> <p>Abstract: While tracking time may seem like a mundane task that in and of itself consumes your time, if monitored and assessed regularly it can be useful to create a record of your work and to identify potential areas for improving efficiency. The timetrackR Shiny app provides a high-level summary of active, inactive and upcoming projects, as well as visualizations for the percentage of time spent by project or project investigator, number of hours spent on each project, and a timeline framing each project’s trajectory from planning through analysis and manuscript preparation. With the option to filter by year, investigator and analyst, the app is versatile enough to use for an individual or for an entire team as well as for use on a regular basis and for year-end or longer-term reviews of how time was spent. I will highlight the key features of the app and demonstrate how to integrate into your current workflow.<\/p> <p>Bio: Jessica Lavery is a Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. She has an MS in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2014) and as of Fall 2019 is also pursuing a doctorate in public health (DrPH) in Biostatistics at Columbia University. Her research focuses primarily on retrospective analyses using institutional and claims data sources. She also serves as the[masked] Volunteer Coordinator for the Caucus for Women in Statistics. Follow her on Twitter @jessicalavs<\/p> <p>Title: Creating publication-ready and reproducible analytical tables with gtsummary<br/>Presenter: Margie Hannum<\/p> <p>Abstract: A critical aspect of many data analysis projects is presenting tables of summary statistics and regression model results. However, summarizing results into publication-ready tables often requires a lot of extra code to customize (e.g. create reference line for categorical variables, format p-values a certain way, bold variable labels, merge multiple model results into one table, etc.). The {gtsummary} package provides an elegant and flexible way to make summary and analytic tables in R. Written as a companion to the {gt} package from RStudio, the {gtsummary} package summarizes data sets, regression models, and more, using sensible defaults with highly customizable capabilities. It also allows you to pull values straight from these tables for use in inline text so that every portion of your R markdown analysis report is reproducible. This talk will go over the functionality of the {gtsummary} package, and how you can use it to create beautifully formatted, ready-to-share summary and result tables in a single line of R code.<\/p> <p>Bio: Margie Hannum is a Biostatistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Her research collaborations largely involve using multi-modal genomic and single cell data to characterize cancer subpopulations. She contributes to the {gtsummary} package and uses it every day in her analysis pipelines. Twitter: @Margaret_Hannum<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>We are excited to invite you to our first event of 2020!<br/>During this event, Martine Jansen will give a workshop on R Markdown. R Markdown provides a way to integrate code and report content into high quality documents. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats. In this workshop we will create an R Markdown document, in which we use the tidyverse to read a csv and manipulate it. After adding some analyses and plots, we will write inline R code, so the text in the report changes depending on the data. We present the resulting analysis with one click in a nicely formatted Word document. After this workshop you will have the tools to start your own analysis projects with RStudio.<\/p> <p>Martine Jansen works for Fontys University of Applied Sciences as an institutional researcher. Another form of this workshop was presented at the EAIR forum 2019 in Leiden and at R-Ladies Amsterdam.<\/p> <p>**PLEASE NOTE THE CHANGED DATE**<\/p> <p>Date: Tuesday, February 18th, 2020<br/>Starting time: 6PM<br/>Location: Avans Hogeschool Den Bosch (walking distance from train station)<\/p> <p>As a local R-Ladies chapter, we want to host accessible workshops and create a community of R-enthusiasts where everyone can develop their R skills.

There is so much you can do with R. However, there may be times when your data does not fit into one of the base types and/or you want to add metadata to vectors. vctrs is a developer-focused package that provides a clear path for creating your own S3-vector class, while ensuring that the classes you build integrate into user expectations for how vectors work in R. This presentation will discuss the why and how of using vctrs through the example of debkeepr, a package for integrating historical non-decimal currencies such as pounds, shillings, and pence into R. The presentation will provide a step-by-step process for developing various types of vectors and thinking through the design process of how vectors of different classes should work together.<\/p> <p>** About Talk1 Speaker **<br/>I am a historian of early modern Europe and currently a lecturer at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. My research investigates the significance of sibling relationships and inheritance in the development of early modern capitalism. I have been using R for approximately two and a half years to analyze and visualize historical data. I am the author of two R packages that should be on CRAN shortly. The opencage package geocodes locations and is written in concert with Maëlle Salmon and Daniel Possenriede, among others. I am also writing a package called debkeepr that integrates non-decimal currencies into R through the basis provided by the vctrs package.<\/p> <p>**Talk2** (25min talk, 5min Q&amp;A)<br/>Title: “Starter Guide to R Plumber + Slack”<br/>Presented by: Emad Hasan, Founder &amp; COO at Retina<\/p> <p>In this talk, I will cover how you can use R Plumber to interact with Slack and surface analysis and data directly in Slack on demand.

    "description": "<p>**Sign up on Eventbrite not Meetup**<br/><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/95552487061/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/95552487061/<\/a><\/p> <p>Overview<\/p> <p>From data to dashboards in a day. Learn the art and science of developing interesting, informative, and interactive dashboard in today’s most popular analytics and visualization tool Tableau. This workshop will discuss the workflow, tools, and design concepts you need to create engaging dashboard reports. The design of a dashboard can be the difference between a dashboard that is hardly used versus one that becomes a popular tool of decision-makers.<\/p> <p>Audience<\/p> <p>This workshop is focused on anyone who is responsible for the development, management, or utilization of dashboard reporting in daily decision-making. Dashboard creators will learn how to build better dashboards for their audience. Dashboard users learn what is required to build great dashboards so they can provide feedback during development. Attendees can benefit from this information even if you’re an analyst or an executive. Everyone can benefit from becoming more data literate in our data-driven society.<\/p> <p>The Benefits<\/p> <p>Attendees will increase their understanding of data and become more effective at communicating with it. What is taught in this workshop is immediately applicable to the workplace. While the tool being taught is Tableau, the workshop is much more than learning a new tool. Attendees will learn what it takes to build effective dashboards that inform and influence their audience versus a data dump that end users are intimidated by.<\/p> <p>Location and Parking<\/p> <p>The event will take place in the Multipurpose Academic &amp; Administrative Building (MPAA) which is attached to the Social Science Parking Structure (SSPS).

This used to be a challenging task but with RStudio and the packages, devtools and rtools it is pretty easy. Peter Stemler is going to introduce give a hands-on tutorial to create a package. We'll dive into the structure of a package and what each directory and file does and cover how to document your code, add datasets, export/import functions, check, build and use your package in your other projects.<\/p> <p>Make sure that you bring a laptop with RStudio installed along with devtools and the roxygen2 package. If you are on a Windows machine you may want to also install the rtools package.<\/p> <p>Come early, network and enjoy the food. Do not forget your laptop with R and Python installed.<\/p> <p># Schedule<\/p> <p>6:30 - 6:50 Networking<br/>6:50 - 7:00 Welcome &amp; general announcement<br/>7:00 - 8:00 Peter Stemler: Building R Packages<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Networking and Clean-up<\/p> ",

City Creek has free two hour parking or you can take the Trax blue or green line to the City Center station.<\/p> <p>The most commonly taught types of regression are linear (where the dependent variable can be any real number) and logistic (where the dependent variable is binary). However, many types of data don't fall into either of these two categories. In this session, we will review regression techniques that can handle other kinds of inputs: censored normal, logit-normal, and beta regression (for dependent variables that are bounded above and/or below); ordered logistic regression (for multiple discrete outcomes that are logically ordered, such as Likert ratings); and multinomial logistic regression (for discrete outcomes that aren't ordered). These techniques provide a better representation of the processes they are modeling and allow us to make more realistic predictions.<\/p> <p>Abby Kaplan is a data scientist at Salt Lake Community College.

Record linkage is the body of knowledge about how to approach this situation in its thornier manifestations and naturally this body of knowledge has its own specialized algorithms and software tools.<\/p> <p>You can easily verify that the speaker has a very common first and last name, and hopefully this will give you a sense of why record linkage at scale is not a trivial exercise.<\/p> <p>I will give a Step 0 introduction to R's RecordLinkage library including technical and business perspectives on \"Who Cares?\", an overview of just what is the library, a walkthrough of the data intuition around some pre-packaged synthetic datasets, and an application of the library to some simple problems posed to the included data.<\/p> ",

She’s also the founder of the non-profit Women in Machine Learning &amp; Data Science (WiMLDS.org) organization and co-founder of the R-Ladies Global organization. She received her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley where her research focused on machine learning and statistical computing.

H2O is an open-source, distributed machine learning platform is designed to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. We will provide a brief overview of the field of Automatic Machine Learning, followed by a detailed look inside H2O’s AutoML algorithm. H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface that automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models (including multiple stacked ensemble models for superior model performance), and due to the distributed nature of the H2O platform, H2O AutoML can scale to very large datasets. The result of the AutoML run is a “leaderboard” of H2O models which can be easily exported for use in production. R code examples are available on GitHub for participants to follow along on their laptops.<\/p> <p>--<\/p> <p>Q: Are men welcome to attend this event?<br/>A: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor.

For example, the number of neighbors in a nearest-neighbor classification model. The tidymodels collection or R packages are a tidyverse interface to modeling. In this talk, the new tune package will be introduced. Examples of the tidy interface to model tuning will be demonstrated.<\/p> <p>Max Kuhn is a software engineer at RStudio. He is currently working on improving R's modeling capabilities. He was a Senior Director of Nonclinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R&amp;D in Connecticut. He was applying models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 18 years. Max has a Ph.D. in Biostatistics.<\/p> <p>Max is the author of numerous R packages for techniques in machine learning and reproducible research and is an Associate Editor for the Journal of Statistical Software. He, and Kjell Johnson, wrote the book Applied Predictive Modeling, which won the Ziegel award from the American Statistical Association, which recognizes the best book reviewed in Technometrics in 2015. Their latest book, Feature Engineering and Selection, was published in 2019.<\/p> ",

It originated with a clever student's IntroStat class final project! The research consists of 1 patent-pending statistical model for calculating the quality of a baseball pitch, 8 million Major League Baseball (MLB) pitches calculated, 12 thousand lines of R code, 15 MLB teams consulted, and 1 active Twitter handle @qopbaseball. In the first part of the presentation (~30min.), I will tell the origin story and development, with special attention given to the R work and lessons learned along the way. The second part of the presentation (~20min.) will be guided according to audience interest. I will take questions on any aspects of the project. I will have code and data on hand for demonstration. Sample data will be provided for audience explorations.<\/p> <p># Live-streaming &amp; Meeting Materials<br/>- All announcements and presentations will be live-streamed and recorded starting at 7:00 PM.

If you’re worried about attending SatRdays alone, then this will be a great chance to meet a few friendly faces who you’ll recognise the next day. Alternatively, if you’d been on the fence of making the journey to Newcastle hopefully this will act as an extra enticement!<br/> <br/>We're so excited for SatRdays and hope to see as many R-Ladies members as possible.

Both have had rich and varied careers, so this is a great chance to hear about their experiences. We’ll be taking some questions on the day, but for the best chance of having your questions answered please submit them in the comments below or message one of us organisers.<br/> <br/>Example questions:<br/>What was it like moving away from academia? And what advice would you give to others thinking about making the transition<br/>What do you think is the most valuable skill you use in your roles as data scientists?<br/>What is your favourite trick in R? E.g. nifty shortcuts, handy functions<br/>What do you look for when joining a new team?<br/>Do you have any advice on making sure we’re bringing R-Ladies principles in to our jobs?<br/> <br/>We anticipate this event will be well attended so book your place asap.

    "description": "<p>Spend Friday night discussing How Charts Lie (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Charts-Lie-Getting-Information/dp/1324001569\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/How-Charts-Lie-Getting-Information/dp/1324001569<\/a>).<\/p> <p>A leading data visualization expert explores the negative―and positive―influences that charts have on our perception of truth.<\/p> <p>We’ve all heard that a picture is worth a thousand words, but what if we don’t understand what we’re looking at? Social media has made charts, infographics, and diagrams ubiquitous―and easier to share than ever. We associate charts with science and reason; the flashy visuals are both appealing and persuasive. Pie charts, maps, bar and line graphs, and scatter plots (to name a few) can better inform us, revealing patterns and trends hidden behind the numbers we encounter in our lives. In short, good charts make us smarter―if we know how to read them.<\/p> <p>However, they can also lead us astray. Charts lie in a variety of ways―displaying incomplete or inaccurate data, suggesting misleading patterns, and concealing uncertainty―or are frequently misunderstood, such as the confusing cone of uncertainty maps shown on TV every hurricane season. To make matters worse, many of us are ill-equipped to interpret the visuals that politicians, journalists, advertisers, and even our employers present each day, enabling bad actors to easily manipulate them to promote their own agendas.<\/p> <p>In How Charts Lie, data visualization expert Alberto Cairo teaches us to not only spot the lies in deceptive visuals, but also to take advantage of good ones to understand complex stories. Public conversations are increasingly propelled by numbers, and to make sense of them we must be able to decode and use visual information. By examining contemporary examples ranging from election-result infographics to global GDP maps and box-office record charts, How Charts Lie demystifies an essential new literacy, one that will make us better equipped to navigate our data-driven world.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",
