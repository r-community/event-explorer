    "description": "<p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Bayesian statistics is becoming more popular in data science. Data scientists are often not trained in Bayesian statistics and if they are, it is usually part of their graduate training. During this talk, we will introduce an introductory course in Bayesian statistics for learners at the undergraduate level and comparably trained practitioners. We will share tools for teaching (and learning) the first course in Bayesian statistics, specifically the {bayesrules} package that accompanies the open-access Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with R book (<a href=\"https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/<\/a>). We will provide an outline of the curriculum and examples for novice learners and their instructors.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Mine Dogucu is an Assistant Professor of Teaching and Vice-Chair of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Statistics at the University of California Irvine. She teaches statistics and data science courses at undergraduate and graduate levels. She is interested in creating educational resources for statistics and data science that are accessible physically and cognitively. She is a co-Principal Investigator on a project funded by the National Science Foundation’s Harnessing the Data Revolution: Data Science Corps program. Through this project, along with her colleagues, she aims to improve data science education infrastructure in Southern California institutions at UC Irvine, Cal State Fullerton, Cypress College, and beyond and tries to connect data science students with industry and research partners for real data science experiences. She is the coauthor of the book Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with R.<\/p> ",

However, there is a significant learning curve with R that inhibits our ability to learn faster methods. Repetitive tasks in spreadsheets or even in R itself can often be revised to be faster, use less code, and have a simpler output One of the more appealing aspects of other programming languages for data science (Python, C++, SQL) relative to R is the speed that they can execute tasks. However, R has the capacity to function as fast, or better, than some of these other languages with some additional parametrization. This workshop will explore the power of “for” loops and parallel computing. These tools, while on the surface may appear intimidating, can be learned quickly with an exceptional payoff in time-saving efficiency. Using a combination of lecture and hands-on activities, this workshop will familiarize yourself with the tools necessary for improving your relationship with R and saving you time. A basic understanding of R is recommended because it will make the content more relevant and understandable. There is no prior knowledge necessarily for parallel computing or programming. Participants should bring a laptop with R already install using Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.).<\/p> <p>Who: The course is aimed at R beginners or experienced analysts.<\/p> ",

Recent breakthroughs in the targets ecosystem make it easy to create ambitious, domain-specific, reproducible data analysis pipelines. Two highlights include {stantargets}, a new rOpenSci package that generates specialized workflows for Stan models while reducing the required volume of user-side R code, and Target Markdown, an R Markdown interface to transparently communicate the entire process of pipeline construction and prototyping.

    "description": "<p>Please welcome our next speaker - Danielle Clake will share her work on bumble bees and landscape fragmentation using R.<\/p> <p>The loss of habitat is a well-known challenge facing global biodiversity, but we still require a better understanding of how specific aspects of landscape changes can affect communities. For example, while the amount of habitat available to a species is known to be important for its survival, there can also be an influence of the configuration of that habitat into one or many patches, or of the patches into either simple or complex shapes. Different landscape metrics have been developed to characterize these and other differences between habitats. R provides useful tools to calculate and assess landscape metrics, and to integrate the results into downstream analysis and modelling.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Danielle will provide a brief overview of the basics of spatial data and geographic information system (GIS) analysis in R, using the sf and raster packages to create and visualize spatial data. She will then show how the landscapemetrics package can be used to characterize the composition and configuration of landscapes.<\/p> <p>Her research on bumble bee (Bombus sp.) habitat in the Rocky Mountains is an example of how these types of landscape analyses can be applied to test hypotheses about the relationships between species and the landscapes that they inhabit. Danielle will discuss her findings in this project, and the various uses of R throughout.<\/p> ",

Cada encuentro será guiado por uno o dos integrantes del grupo.<\/p> <p>• En el primer encuentro discutiremos el capitulo número 3 “visualización de datos” (¡Qué bueno, empezamos con gráficos con ggplot2 ) <a href=\"https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/visualizaci%C3%B3n-de-datos.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/visualizaci%C3%B3n-de-datos.html<\/a> Es necesario llegar a la reunión con el capítulo previamente leído y trabajado. Quienes no leyeron la introducción del libro aún: adelante, es corta, y les dará un panorama de lo que iremos estudiando. En la reunión de organización vimos un panorama de la introducción.<\/p> <p>• En base a la encuesta de horarios que hicimos, hemos definido tres grupos de trabajo con distintos horarios. ¡ATENCIÓN! ¡Por favor, anotarse solo en uno de los tres! AHORA ESTÁS EN EL MEETUP DEL GRUPO DE LUNES DE 9 A 11 AM.<\/p> <p>• ¡Importante! Ni bien se inscriban en el meetup, entren a los ajustes de su perfil y verifiquen tener activas las notificaciones, no sólo del meetup en general, sino del grupo RLadies-BRC en particular (figuran abajo del todo en notificaciones por correo electrónico) para poder recibir luego el enlace para conectarse y otras notificaciones relacionadas al evento.<\/p> <p>• Quienes se inscriban al meetup y si aún no se sumaron, van a recibir más adelante un enlace para sumarse al espacio de trabajo de slack que es exclusivo para el estudio del libro y que será nuestra principal vía de comunicación. Si nunca lo usaron y/o necesitan ayuda para familiarizarse, escríbannos y les damos una orientación rápida.<\/p> <p>• Necesitamos uno o dos voluntarias o voluntarios para guiar el capítulo número 3. Interesadxs nos lo pueden comunicar por el slack o al correo [masked]. Cuanto antes, mejor. En caso de que nadie se ofrezca, haremos un sorteo (con el comando sample() en R!!!).<\/p> <p>• A partir del primer encuentro, cada grupo de trabajo se auto-gestionará. Por ejemplo, sorteará o decidirá quién guiará el siguiente capítulo, si verán un capítulo, medio capítulo o dos capítulos (la propuesta general es ir despacio, lento pero sin tregua), si aplicarán lo que se vió en el capítulo a otro set de datos etc. Contamos con el espacio de slack para consultarnos y compartir información en cada grupo y entre grupos.<\/p> <p>Al anotarse, les pedimos que primero lean y acepten el código de conducta que encontrarán en la página.<\/p> <p>Para asistir al meetup, les recomendamos poseer una cuenta de google (utilizaremos google meet). Se recomienda tener conocimientos básicos de R.<\/p> <p>¡ATENCIÓN! por cuestiones de seguridad virtual, el enlace a la reunión se enviará unos minutos antes de la misma.

In this workshop, we’ll explore some core principles of the Bayesian philosophy, learn to think like Bayesians, and get our hands on some Bayesian models. The workshop materials will rely on the following R packages: tidyverse, bayesrules, bayesplot, rstan, rstanarm. The rstan package in particular would be great to install in advance and works best with R version 4.0.0 or later.<\/p> <p>About Speaker<\/p> <p>Alicia Johnson is an associate professor of statistics at Macalester College in St Paul, Minnesota. Her research interests span Bayesian statistics, computational statistics, and statistics / data science education.

During this event, she will be talking about software and experimental design.<\/p> <p>Analysing data is unimaginable without a statistical software. Anyone who requires statistical computing on a regular basis would frequently interact with a statistical software and therefore the interface design can have a radical effect on the masses. In this talk, She will dive into a range of programming paradigms with relation to the interface design of software. She will then discuss in-depth about a novel computational framework, called the \"grammar of experimental design\", and its implementation as the edibble R-package.<\/p> <p>Dr. Emi Tanaka is a lecturer in statistics at Monash University whose primary interest is to develop impactful statistical methods and tools that can readily be used by practitioners. Her research area include data visualisation, mixed models and experimental designs, motivated primarily by problems in bioinformatics and agricultural sciences. She is currently the President of the Statistical Society of Australia Victorian Branch and is an avid programmer in R, HTML/CSS and other computational languages.<\/p> <p>This will be an online event.

It has a huge Twitter community and is one of the best ways to practice and develop tidyverse skills, whether you’re still reviewing the basics or have quite the repertoire. This series has something for everyone and is especially designed to be beginner friendly!<\/p> <p>It's important to us to ensure that Guided Tidy Tuesday is a safe space for gender minorities and especially those who are just starting out with R. Studies have shown that letting gender minorities speak first promotes a welcoming and supportive atmosphere for underrepresented groups. All are welcome at this meetup but we specifically ask cisgender men to take a passive role in this meetup and hold comments / questions until after others have had the chance to ask.

Many of us struggle to use theme(), or need to consult Google every time to find the correct command...<\/p> <p>After this workshop, you'll feel more comfortable with harnessing the power of theme(). We'll dive into text elements like titles and labels, as well as explore the options concerning axes, legends, gridlines and the plot background in a structured way so you understand just how theme() works.<\/p> <p>This is the first in 3 \"level up your ggplot\" meetups -- feel free to join any or all in any order.

In the past years, Bayesian methods have become increasingly popular because they provide several advantages to the applied researcher, such as the ability to quantify evidence and successively update it as data come in.<\/p> <p>In this workshop, I will give an introduction to the basic concepts of Bayesian statistics, such as the prior distribution, the posterior distribution, and the Bayes factor. After a brief conceptual introduction, we will fit a simple Bayesian model using just Base-R. I will finish the workshop by giving an outlook to more complex models, and present R-packages that can be used for advanced hypothesis testing and parameter estimation in the Bayesian framework.<\/p> <p>ABOUT ANGELIKA<br/>---------------------<\/p> <p>I am a PhD student in the Psychological Methods department at the University of Amsterdam. My research mostly focuses on subjective Bayesian methods and experimental design planning; that is, I investigate statistical methods that can make research in psychology more efficient and allow researchers to incorporate existing knowledge into their models. I am a member of the JASP team and a co-founder of the ReproducibiliTea Amsterdam chapter. I am passionate about making science and statistics accessible to everyone, and have given various workshops about Bayesian statistics and Open Science in the past.<\/p> ",

As usual, the meeting is open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are especially welcome.<\/p> <p>In order to join us, please register with MeetUp (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/EdinbR/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/EdinbR/<\/a>).<\/p> <p>We're using a chat group for EdinbR, come and catch up with the community on Matrix (<a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#edinbr:matrix.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://matrix.to/#/#edinbr:matrix.org<\/a>).<br/>Our talk this month will primarily be available on Matrix - along with session chat. We will also be running a stream to YouTube, if you are unable to join us on Matrix.<\/p> <p>Our speakers are Amieroh Abrahams and Marjan van de Weg.<\/p> <p>* **Amieroh Abrahams** is an Oceanographer turned data scientist at Fathom Data. She spends an inordinate amount of time working in R and developing training material in other technology at the Training wing of Fathom Data. Amieroh enjoys hiking and loves visiting the ocean.<\/p> <p>* **Marjan van de Weg** is the senior data consultant at Changeworks (<a href=\"https://www.changeworks.org.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.changeworks.org.uk/<\/a>), a Scottish environmental NGO that is helping Scotland to become more energy efficient and switch to low carbon heating. She used R in her previous academic work and at Changeworks she leads the data analysis on projects for local authorities.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## How Oceanographers use R to detect the impact of Climate Change<\/p> <p>### Amieroh Abrahams (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AbrahamsAmieroh\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/AbrahamsAmieroh<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Bakun (1990) hypothesized that an increase in greenhouse gases will result in considerable changes of global wind patterns and ultimately affect oceanic processes. Is this true? Join me and explore how R was used to test this hypothesis. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.626411\" class=\"linkified\">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.626411<\/a><\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Using R at an environmental NGO<\/p> <p>### Marjan van de Weg (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarjanWeg\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/MarjanWeg<\/a>)<\/p> <p>In her talk, Marjan will discuss how and when her data team uses R for the projects, such as local heat and energy efficiency strategies (LHEES) and the monitoring and evaluation of energy efficiency and low carbon heating. Marjan will also discuss the specifics of using R in a non-specialist (NGO) context.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>/federico<\/p> ",

She put it aside, thinking it was one of those detective tales she loved. When she read it on a rainy Saturday, she discovered she was right, in a way. As she sped through the pages, she became enthralled by the intense drama behind the competition to discover the code of life. Even though her high school counselor told her girls didn’t become scientists, she decided she would.<\/p> <p>Driven by a passion to understand how nature works and to turn discoveries into inventions, she would help to make what the book’s author, James Watson, told her was the most important biological advance since his co-discovery of the structure of DNA. She and her collaborators turned ​a curiosity ​of nature into an invention that will transform the human race: an easy-to-use tool that can edit DNA. Known as CRISPR, it opened a brave new world of medical miracles and moral questions.<\/p> <p>The development of CRISPR and the race to create vaccines for coronavirus will hasten our transition to the next great innovation revolution. The past half-century has been a digital age, based on the microchip, computer, and internet. Now we are entering a life-science revolution. Children who study digital coding will be joined by those who study genetic code.<\/p> <p>Should we use our new evolution-hacking powers to make us less susceptible to viruses? What a wonderful boon that would be! And what about preventing depression? Hmmm…Should we allow parents, if they can afford it, to enhance the height or muscles or IQ of their kids?<\/p> <p>After helping to discover CRISPR, Doudna became a leader in wrestling with these moral issues and, with her collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier, won the Nobel Prize in 2020. Her story is a thrilling detective tale that involves the most profound wonders of nature, from the origins of life to the future of our species.<\/p> ",

Thank you Reiko for bringing your R-Ladies Vancouver presentation to R-Ladies Seattle!<\/p> <p>Event Description: R packages are a collection of functions, documentation, and sample data. Not only do they provide an excellent framework for organizing your code, but they also make it easier to share code with other R users. In this workshop, we’ll develop a simple R package together to gain an understanding of the key steps of package development. I’ll also reflect on my experiences creating an internal package for my team at the BC Ministry of Health. I hope to shed light on the lesser-known non-technical aspects of package development by discussing how to identify what tools your teammates need to succeed and how to encourage them to adopt your package. This workshop is geared towards (but not limited to) those who are new to developing packages and those who are thinking of creating one to share within their organization and beyond.<\/p> <p>**This workshop assumes you know how to write a function in R and are familiar with the RStudio IDE.

In this talk, we present the R package varycoef that implements estimation, prediction, and variable selection of linear models with spatially varying coefficients (SVC) defined by GPs, so called GP-based SVC models. Such models offer a high degree of flexibility while being relatively easy to interpret. Using varycoef, we show versatile applications of (spatially) varying coefficient models on spatial and time series data. This includes model and coefficient estimation with predictions and variable selection. The package uses state-of-the-art computational statistics techniques like parallelization, model-based optimization, and covariance tapering. This allows the user to work with (S)VC models in a computationally efficient manner, i.e., model estimation on large data sets is possible in a feasible amount of time.<\/p> ",

Speaking python inside of R workflows<\/p> <p>Sometimes you need to speak snake. Becoming proficient in both Python and R has become a necessary skill in today’s data analytical landscape, to maximize productivity among communities of analysts working in either or both platforms, and to take full advantage of the unique capabilities each language offers. Rstudio has written a package for the R language that unifies operation of both languages within the R session: {reticulate}. I will demonstrate an ETL procedure used in my daily work that uses python functions sourced from a package of my own design to extract data from a Microsoft OLAP cube, and embeds these functions into an R script, seamlessly integrating into a {dplyr} pipe chain. From this demonstration, R users will learn a) the basics of calling python from within R, b) how to structure the python functions to work with {dplyr} verbs, and c) common strategies for maintaining reproducibility when using both languages.<\/p> <p>Second presenter: John Blischak, Freelance Scientific Software Developer<\/p> <p>OmicNavigator (<a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/package=OmicNavigator\" class=\"linkified\">https://cran.r-project.org/package=OmicNavigator<\/a>) is an R package for organizing, sharing, and exploring the results of genomics experiments. All the data wrangling is handled in R, and the interactive exploration is performed in a web app built with JavaScript.

    "description": "<p>Whether you are a beginner or are needing a refresh, you can join this training to gain familiarity with the statistical programming language R and learn how to take your data and reporting to the next level.<\/p> <p>We have developed this intro level training to give people a leg up to get started toward reporting and dashboards in R - we would appreciate if you could share with potentially interested colleagues outside of the group. Hope to see some of you there, too!<\/p> <p>ABOUT THIS EVENT:<br/>Have you got lots of ideas of what you want to do with your data but just can’t get there yet? Over 5 sessions we will look into the basics of the statistical programming language R and how it can be applied to data visualisation and automated report generation. We cover data cleaning and pre-processing, transforming your data, displaying it in multiple formats (data table and plots), and finally tying it all together in a R Markdown file that you can save and share with your audience. We will work through multiple datasets and exercises so on conclusion of the class you can hit the ground running.<\/p> <p>WHO SHOULD ATTEND:<br/>You are new to R or feel a bit rusty with your R skills and have a keen interest in furthering your ability to manage, display and share data. Maybe you have been mainly using Excel or an off-the shelf tool like Power BI, but are frustrated by its limitations and are keen to build more advanced visuals to do your data justice. You might have a dataset or model you want to prepare outputs for and want to progress to a more powerful, efficient and streamlined process. This Masterclass can be used as an entry into R or can be used as preparation for our R Shiny Masterclasses.<\/p> <p>INSTRUCTORS:<br/>Dr. Uli Muellner (Director — IT &amp; Information Design)<br/>Crystal Johnston (Full-Stack Developer)<br/>Nick Snellgrove (Full-Stack Developer)<\/p> <p>FORMAT:<br/>5 interactive online sessions; supported by dedicated online learning plattform for asynchronous learning and interaction.<\/p> <p>COST<br/>$985 NZD (excl. GST)<\/p> <p>Learn more and register at www.epi-interactive.com/events/r-for-data-visualisation<\/p> ",

Readers of systematic reviews and meta-analyses may be patients, clinicians, administrators, or policymakers and therefore possess a wide range of skill in understanding research terms. It is important that authors of systematic reviews and meta-analyses make every effort to guide readers in making the best use of results in myriad clinical contexts and settings. Dr. Moss will present a critical appraisal of the methodological approach of a published systematic review and meta-analysis that culminates with a brief tutorial that compares the statistical approach to meta-analysis in STATA and R.<\/p> <p>Dr. Moss received her BSc in Biochemistry from the University of Calgary, her MSc in Pharmacology from the University of Alberta, and her PhD in Epidemiology from the University of Calgary. Her most important scholarly contributions to date have centered on how to best partner with citizens in research. Thought leaders and funding agencies have been advocating with limited success for years for researcher-citizen partnerships to maximize the relevance and impact of scholarly work.

The link to the meeting will be visible for registered participants shortly before the beginning of the event (at the latest).<\/p> <p>----<\/p> <p>New technologies and research in the field of machine learning and deep learning methods and new ways of accessing, integrating and analyzing sensitive personal data increase the demand for solutions to be able to respect laws on data privacy and confidentiality. Fields of applications include official statistics and social sciences, financial transactions, social network activities, location trajectories, CRM, insurance data and medical records.<br/>New data protection regulations, that especially include high penalties for violating privacy, put the topic of statistical disclosure control in focus.<\/p> <p>There are a lot of different concepts to consider data privacy. To name a few: privacy preserving computation, remote execution, remote access, synthetic data, and statistical disclosure control. We focus on the latter one. Statistical disclosure control includes the measurement of the re-identification risk of persons in a data set, the anonymization of data and the measurement of the information loss after anonymization. After anonymization the data include no link to persons, and thus all the rules on privacy do no longer apply.<\/p> <p>Based on an application using the European Survey of Income and Living Condition, we show the S4 class R package sdcMicro in action. Note, that each anonymization should be done very data- and use-case specific, and an anonymization of different kinds of data (e.g. mobility data, event history data, time series, longitudinal data) needs different solutions.<\/p> <p>The audience is expected to have knowledge in base R.<\/p> <p>Further readings, resources and documents:<\/p> <p>Publications (selection):<br/>- Journal of Statistical Software: sdcMicro<br/><a href=\"https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v067i04\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v067i04<\/a><br/>- Publication about sdc app<br/><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/12/9/191/htm\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/12/9/191/htm<\/a><br/>- Online test version<br/><a href=\"https://sdctools.shinyapps.io/sdcapp/\" class=\"linkified\">https://sdctools.shinyapps.io/sdcapp/<\/a><br/>- Book on SDC in Springer<br/><a href=\"https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319502700\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319502700<\/a><\/p> <p>Resources:<br/>- sdcMicro development on github<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/sdcTools/sdcMicro\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/sdcTools/sdcMicro<\/a><br/>- sdcMicro stable CRAN version<br/><a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdcMicro/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdcMicro/index.html<\/a><\/p> <p>See also:<br/>- International Household Survey Network<br/><a href=\"http://www.ihsn.org/software/disclosure-control-toolbox\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ihsn.org/software/disclosure-control-toolbox<\/a><br/>- World Bank Group<br/><a href=\"http://surveys.worldbank.org/sdcmicro\" class=\"linkified\">http://surveys.worldbank.org/sdcmicro<\/a><\/p> ",

As usual, the meeting is open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are especially welcome.<\/p> <p>We're using a chat group for EdinbR, come and catch up with the community on Matrix (<a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#edinbr:matrix.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://matrix.to/#/#edinbr:matrix.org<\/a>).<br/>Our talk this month will primarily be available on Matrix - along with session chat. We will also be running a stream to YouTube, if you are unable to join us on Matrix.<\/p> <p>Our speakers are Amieroh Abrahams and Marjan van de Weg.<\/p> <p>* **Amieroh Abrahams** is an Oceanographer turned data scientist at Fathom Data. She spends an inordinate amount of time working in R and developing training material in other technology at the Training wing of Fathom Data. Amieroh enjoys hiking and loves visiting the ocean.<\/p> <p>* **Marjan van de Weg** is the senior data consultant at Changeworks (<a href=\"https://www.changeworks.org.uk/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.changeworks.org.uk/<\/a>), a Scottish environmental NGO that is helping Scotland to become more energy efficient and switch to low carbon heating. She used R in her previous academic work and at Changeworks she leads the data analysis on projects for local authorities.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## How Oceanographers use R to detect the impact of Climate Change<\/p> <p>### Amieroh Abrahams (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AbrahamsAmieroh\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/AbrahamsAmieroh<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Bakun (1990) hypothesized that an increase in greenhouse gases will result in considerable changes of global wind patterns and ultimately affect oceanic processes. Is this true? Join me and explore how R was used to test this hypothesis. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.626411\" class=\"linkified\">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2021.626411<\/a><\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Using R at an environmental NGO<\/p> <p>### Marjan van de Weg (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarjanWeg\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/MarjanWeg<\/a>)<\/p> <p>In her talk, Marjan will discuss how and when her data team uses R for the projects, such as local heat and energy efficiency strategies (LHEES) and the monitoring and evaluation of energy efficiency and low carbon heating.
