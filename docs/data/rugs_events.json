In this talk I will discuss the fundamentals of building a web application using HTML/JavaScript/CSS, and how those fundamentals are used to build web applications in Shiny using R, using examples I have created in both environments. For anyone who wants to understand website structure or get the most out of their Shiny app, I hope this talk will shed some light!<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Amy Tzu-Yu Chen (@amy17519), Data Scientist at System1<br/>Title: Data Science Reporting: Tips and Tricks for useRs<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>We (data practitioners) spend most of time working on data analysis and model development but we often forget that it is as important to advocate and maintain model health, especially in a production environment. Building data science reports ahead of time can help. In this talk, let's talk about how to make useful data science reports for data scientists and business stakeholders. In this talk, we will first walk through what data science reporting means and how it is different from BI and general-purpose dashboards. Next, we explore different options for producing data science reports in a \"loud\" and clear way for data scientists and other technical and non-technical business stakeholders. Throughout the talk, I will introduce some useful R packages and tricks for building your own reports.<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>Timeline:<br/>6:30: Socializing<br/>7:00-8:00: Talks<br/>8:00: Socializing<\/p> <p>Address:<br/>Room 115/116<br/>USC<br/>2001 N.

If you're interested in taking it, please submit an application at the link below! We aim to meet the needs of a broad group of people across campus and in the community, so we implemented an application that asks for department/lab affiliation.<\/p> <p>Please apply here, details also below! <a href=\"https://registration.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/events/datalab-data-carpentry-workshop-2019/\" class=\"linkified\">https://registration.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/events/datalab-data-carpentry-workshop-2019/<\/a><\/p> <p>Data Carpentry Workshop with R<br/>Dec. 7, 2019, 10 a.m. - Dec. 8, 2019, 6 p.m.<br/>Contact - Please email [masked] or [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>Location - DataLab Classroom (Shields Library room 360). Directions<br/>Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. We will be covering the Data Carpentry Ecology lessons because they are generally applicable to researchers who aim to do data analysis in R. We will cover data management and organization, manipulating, summarizing, and plotting data in R. For more information, please visit our workshop website.<\/p> <p>Who: The course is aimed at graduate students and other academic researchers.<br/>You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.<\/p> <p>Learners must attend both workshop days (Dec 7-8, 2019 from 10am - 6pm each day).<\/p> <p>Cost: $10.

The trouble may be caused by survey non-responses, lost records or machine failures.<br/>Classical packages performing estimation would let you ignore all the lines with missingness, as a result, much information would be lost. A more reasonable method to handle this problem, is modifying an estimation process so that the method can be applied to incomplete data. For example, one can use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimate despite missing values.<br/>Another popular choice is imputation, followed by classical regression procedure on imputed dataset. In this presentation, I will talk about different types of missing data, review several imputation methods and demonstrate how to estimate parameters based on EM algorithm with R.<\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Bio naszych prelengentów:<\/p> <p>Michał Kurtys jest Data Scientistem pracującym w firmie Infermedica.

    "description": "<p>Methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN), or simply “Deep Learning”, are recently gaining more and more popularity in the Data Science industry. They might seem overwhelming for those who never tried to use them, however, the truth is that the basic theory behind it is not that hard to understand. You might be surprised that the simplest neural network is just a linear function. You also might be surprised that learning how to create a Deep Learning model does not require a PhD in math related subject.<\/p> <p>With recent frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras the effort needed to build a DNN is similar to the effort needed to build any other Machine Learning model.<\/p> <p>On this practice oriented workshop you will learn the basics of how DNN work and you will implement a simple one by yourself using the Keras framework in R. We will work on a very simple, yet real world example to showcase the mechanics that powers Deep Learning. We will predict the rent price of an apartment based on its characteristics using the publicly available data originating from AirBnb.<\/p> <p>The instructors Mikołaj Olszewski and Mikołaj Bogucki are both experienced Data Scientists and the founders of idash.pl, a startup which provides Data Science training.

There are various reasons why missing data may occur, including survey non-response, unavailability of measurements, and lost data. In this presentation, I will first share my experience on how to do parametric estimation with missing covariates, based on likelihood methods and Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Then I will focus on recent results of variable selection in high-dimensional settings with missing observations among the covariates. To address this relatively understudied problem, we propose a new synergistic procedure – adaptive Bayesian SLOPE – which effectively combines the SLOPE method (sorted l1 regularization) together with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO method. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of power, FDR and estimation bias under a wide range of scenarios. Finally, we analyze a real dataset consisting of patients from Paris hospitals who underwent a severe trauma, where we show excellent performance in predicting platelet levels.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Wei Jiang is currently pursuing PhD degree in Statistics at Ecole Polytechnique, France.

The methods covered include feature importance, partial dependence &amp; feature interaction, Shapley values (and SHAP) and LIME. This talk will start with an overview of these methods on both structured data and images. Then he'll introduce two use cases at Liberty Mutual: causal modeling of legal claims and vehicle damage prediction, respectively.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Eden Huang is a Data Scientist working at the Legal Data Science Team at Liberty Mutual. The team research and apply machine learning models to automate legal auditing process, classify millions of text-based legal records, predict outcome of cases, estimate causal effect of legal decisions and evaluate the quality of legal handling. He graduated with a M.S. in Statistics from Duke University and a B.S. in Economics from University of Minnesota.<\/p> <p>Talk #2<br/>Topic: Is \"Old Town Road\" Rap or Country? (Explained through using tidymodels, Plumber, and Shiny) - Presented by Josiah Parry<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Old Town Road, is it hip-hop or country? With its initial release, Lil Nas X declared it a country song. Billboard, the industry standard for ranking songs, artists, and albums eventually intervened making a bold statement that the song is not country and would from there forth be classified as hip-hop.<\/p> <p>This serves as the basis for a case study to illustrate the process of developing a sophisticated model and productionizing it using contemporary tools in the R ecosystem. This is done by developing an ensemble model that classifies between country or hip-hop based on its lyrics and audio features. I then explore productionizing the R model by creating a plumber API and a shiny application which are subsequently hosted on RStudio Connect.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Josiah Parry's interests include social science, politics, espresso, data science, and music. He gets to indulge in some of these interests as a Customer Success Representative at RStudio. Josiah is also a Master of Science Candidate at Northeastern University studying Urban Informatics in the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs<\/p> <p>Location:<br/>WeWork One Beacon Street<\/p> <p>WeWork is a community of creators.

    "description": "<p>Abstract: In a multimodal virtual environment (VE) that incorporates a number of senses, i.e., visual, auditory, and touch or haptic, data can be made tangible along with its visual presentation. Variables can be represented as haptic glyphs of different shapes, sizes, and other physical properties such as friction. Audio feedback helps further exploration of the data. However, an effective mapping across different modalities is a challenging task; what is visually accessible by sighted people, may cause information overload if being accessed via touch by the blind or visually impaired (VI). While working on different modalities, equivalent design continues to be emphasized. This pilot study addresses challenges associated with the use of glyphs in multivariate data presentations and identifies the optimum multimodal platform. The result of this pilot study demonstrates that glyphs can be successfully used for presenting multivariate data in a multimodal VE. This glyph-based multimodal presentation makes information available to the blind and VI in a semantic-aware environment. A multimodal VE also enriches the experience of the sighted users.<\/p> <p>Profile of Speaker: Shamima Yasmin, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Eastern Washington University. She received Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering (Structural) from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 1995.

    "description": "<p>By: John Snyder<\/p> <p>Interpreting the effects of individual variables from flexible machine learning models such as random forests or neural networks can be a difficult task. Typically, the flexibility of these methods tends to obfuscate these effects in favor of superior predictive performance. This tradeoff can often leave the data scientist wondering how their inputs are working for them to achieve their predictive accuracy.<\/p> <p>Visualization techniques such as Partial Dependence(PD), Individual Conditional Expectation(ICE) and Accumulated Local Effect(ALE) plots exist to recover some of the global interpretability we would get with a parametric model such as regression. These techniques frequently shed valuable insights into how the features relate to the target variable and make explaining results much easier.<\/p> <p>This month, I will first provide a brief background on why these types of procedures are valuable additions to a data scientist's analytical toolkit. Then, I will discuss the practical usage of the Interpretable Machine Learning(iml) R package, which provides a suite of functionality for analyzing any black box machine learning model. Specifically, we will discuss how to create and interpret PD, ICE, and ALE plots.<\/p> <p>The meetup will be in The Showroom in the CIC building at 20 South Sarah Street, St. Louis, MO 63108.

El análisis de los sistemas ecológicos como redes ha desempeñado un papel central en el desarrollo de la ecología como ciencia. Las redes se pueden agrupar en tres clases, en función de los tipos de organismos e interacciones involucradas: redes tróficas, redes hospedero-parasitoide y redes mutualistas. Las redes mutualistas comprenden las interacciones que son beneficiosas para ambas partes (por ejemplo, redes planta-polinizador y planta-dispersor). Las interacciones han tenido un papel central en la evolución de la biodiversidad terrestre y son el sostén de la diversidad y el funcionamiento de las comunidades naturales.<br/>En los últimos años estás herramientas han pasado de ser investigación pura a investigación aplicada, por ejemplo, se han aplicado en el contexto de la restauración del hábitats, el estudio de invasiones de especies exóticas, el manejo del pastoreo, el control biológico de plagas, la conservación de especies, entre muchas otras.<\/p> <p>:: PÚBLICO ::<br/>El espacio es limitado, por lo que les agradecemos su comprensión.

Kaggle is a community platform for data scientists most well-known for competitive competitions. In this meetup, Philipp and Dmitry who are one of the top ranked data scientists on Kaggle, will talk about their journey on the platform. They will give a short overview of the types of competitions being hosted on Kaggle, before they will go into detail discussing the ins-and-outs of a competition of choice they participated in. Next to methodological insights, the audience should get a feeling of how top Kagglers approach competitions and get insights into some of their thought processes as well as tips and tricks.<\/p> <p>2. Christoph's talk will cover several aspects including<br/>- How weather data can be crunched to explain weather risk in the tourism and energy industry and utilized for real-world forecasting applications<br/>- His experience on a R PhD course with the legendary Roger Bivand and how knowledge gained there was used for mass production of spatial plots<br/>- The transformation of teams of spreadsheet users towards R, who initially would not want to pay a single cent for R<br/>- How a room full of engineers with a massive performance problem of their product in Asia, manifested a self-made visualization engine for log data<\/p> <p>The story how R has been used for a first user activation funnel for a new generation of digital banking a few years ago, with it now being used as the workhorse and backbone in numerous Analytics and AI use cases.<br/>- And last but not least: An outlook beyond the world of R<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKERS<\/p> <p>Philipp Singer currently works as a data scientist in UNIQA Insurance Group.

You might know about how to create static dataviz with R and ggplot2, but there's a whole zoo of htmlwidgets for creating interactive charts, maps, networks and more without learning any JavaScript. Add Shiny to the mix and you can create interactive web applications completely in R.<\/p> <p>But something we often leave out of this conversation is how to make data truly accessible and reproducibly available for the future. Martin will tie together interactive dataviz, Shiny and their work at our R-Ladies Meetup to support an end-to-end reproducible Open Data workflow.<\/p> <p>• About Martin: Martin started learning R on May 29th 2015 to prepare for their role in IT Services at University of Oxford where they lucked out on internal funding to setup the \"Interactive Data Network\" (idn.it.ox.ac.uk), which supports Oxford researchers in creating interactive dataviz of Open Data using Shiny and htmlwidgets. Since founding the IDN, Martin has created several R training courses for LinkedIn Learning and as of 2019 is a full time freelance R consultant and trainer - they're also a die hard reproducible research evangelist.<\/p> <p>• Installation requirements:<br/>Please have the following installed on your computer before this workshop (or come early and we'll help you with installation):<br/>- R<br/>- RStudio<\/p> <p>Run the following command in the R console to make sure you have the appropriate packages installed:<\/p> <p>install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"leaflet\", \"highcharter\", \"rmarkdown\", \"shiny\", \"fivethirtyeight\", \"sf\", \"rnaturalearthdata\")<\/p> <p>• Schedule<br/>5:45-6 -- Installation help, R Tour (please come early for help getting set up with R if you need it!)<br/>6-6:30 -- Food and drinks, Intros &amp; Announcements<br/>6:30-7:30 -- Workshop by Martin<br/>7:30-8:00-- Socializing/Networking/Hanging out/Chillin'<\/p> <p>Q: Are men welcome to attend this event?<br/>A: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor. Please contact [masked] if you have questions.***<\/p> <p>Additionally, please help us by spreading the word about R-Ladies, and by being respectful of the fact that this event is primarily for women/non-binary/female-identifying individuals.<\/p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Yourself!

Come to learn and meet new people in cosy and warm atmosphere :)<\/p> <p>FIRST TALK:<br/>Our first speaker is Shihan Du. She has a PhD in applied econometrics, recently graduated from Copenhagen Business School, and is now working as a part-time researcher at China-Europe Productivity Center.<\/p> <p>Shihan's presentation is about advanced regression frameworks on decomposition techniques to analyze reasons for customer retention. Shihan will show one of her PhD projects - the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and decomposition based on conditional quantiles(non-linear), performed on individual-level data from Statistic Denmark. Principal component analysis (PCA) will also be briefly discussed at the end of the presentation.<\/p> <p>SECOND TALK:<br/>Our second speaker is Peer Christensen, who has a backround in linguistics and cognitive science. While working towards a PhD, he became interested in pursuing a career as a data scientist and spent much time learning R and Python. Peer recently started working at Saxo.com where he finds new ways of leveraging customer and product data to create insights.<\/p> <p>Predicting customer churn is a special case of binary classification, where standard measures of predictive accuracy are misleading when true positive predictions (churn = yes) are more important than true negatives (churn = no).<\/p> <p>Peer will show some of his ongoing work using R and the H2O autoML framework to train and evaluate multiple models in terms of their usefulness in a real-world use case.<\/p> <p>SAVE THE DATE!:<br/>When: December 5<br/>Time: 17:30 - 19:30<br/>Where: Niels Brock<br/>Bispetorvet 3<br/>1167 Copenhagen<\/p> <p>See you all soon!<\/p> <p>Regards,<br/>RLadies CPH<br/>Ivana, Shihan, Peer, Sharon<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Opening the black box is a fertile area of research today. It is apparent to anyone who has ever worked on a machine learning project that in order to realise a wide spread acceptance delivering a high accuracy model is not enough. Stakeholders are demanding transparency in how and why an algorithm is making specific predictions. A variety of approaches can be used to shed light on how algorithms make their decision: from creating alternative and more transparent algorithms that can compete with the black-box one to using robust statistical techniques. During this talk we will explore different methods for unboxing the black-box model, their pros and cons and how I have used them in TripActions.<br/>We will cover the following topics:<br/>1. Importance of human interpretable machine learning and criteria for model interpretation methods.<br/>2. Challenges and limitations of traditional techniques for model interpretation<br/>3. Hands-on example on the latest model interpretation frameworks on a supervised learning example. Using the iml package we will cover permutation importance, SHAP and LIME.<\/p> <p>This workshop is brought to you by Teodora Vrabcheva. :)<\/p> <p>PROGRAM<br/>------------------<br/>[masked] Welcoming :)<br/>18.30- 18.50 Introduction to R-Ladies &amp; Tripactions<br/>18.50- 19.30- Workshop part 1<br/>19.30- 19.45 Break<br/>19.45- 20.30 Workshop part 2<br/>20.30- 21.30 Socialising<\/p> <p>ABOUT TEODORA<br/>--------------------------<br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodora-vrabcheva-8b841826/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodora-vrabcheva-8b841826/<\/a><\/p> <p>My name is Teodora and I am a data scientist with background in statistics.

One way to address this issue is to use a geo experiment: a quasi-experiment that measures the causal impact of a marketing intervention. It's similar to an A/B test but instead of assigning individuals randomly to control and treatment groups, geographic regions are used to define the groups. I will give an introduction on how we use geo experiments at trivago to test the effectiveness of our marketing investments and explain how the tests are set up and analyzed in R.<\/p> <p>My Loan Tong is a data analyst at trivago. With a degree in Business Mathematics and Analytics but no Marketing knowledge, she joined the Marketing Intelligence team two years ago and has since been analyzing TV, Online Video and Out-of-Home campaigns.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>*** Regression specification uncertainty - A smooth brute force approach ***<\/p> <p>abstract and speaker info coming soon<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Thanks to trivago for hosting &amp; sponsoring this edition of the Düsseldorf R User Group Meetup.

For this event please plan on sharing a couple of slides about your own R use case, whether it is for personal or academic/professional projects. We will plan on everyone presenting their slides, saving some time for questions at the end of each presentation. I'm thinking each presentation would last 5-10 minutes (depending on how many attendees we have), making up a 2 hour total duration meeting. Because of the nature of this meeting please be sure to RSVP ahead of time through Meetup, and please add the topic of your presentation (and maybe a short summary) in the comments. Feel free to be creative here. There is no pressure to have something that is conference level polished, we are just hoping to showcase how R is being used by Rladies in the greater Denver area. Based on what is presented, we can hopefully brainstorm some additional topics of interest for future meeting workshops/presentations.<\/p> <p>Feel free to reach out with any questions and pass along this announcement to more “RLadies”. We (Meghan Sposato and Gina Reynolds are co-organizing) hope many can make it to this first meeting and future meetings! 😊 Unfortunately Gina cannot make this meeting, but we will hopefully record the meeting so that she can watch it another time. I am planning on setting up a Zoom call for this meeting for those Coloradans who would like to contribute and/or watch in remotely.<\/p> <p>Meghan<\/p> ",

In addition, we will be able to send further details, such as room numbers or links to materials to your e-mail.<\/p> <p>#############<br/>Talk abstract:<br/>We will cover two topics. Firstly, I will give you an overview about statistical modelling in non-life insurance pricing and its specialties. How can modern machine learning challenge the good old GLM world? What is the role of ML interpretability and explainability in this challenge? I will illustrate the ideas on a large real world motor claims data set.<br/>In the second part I’d like to share some thoughts on model-agnostic measures of interaction strength. How can they be used to efficiently measure overall interaction strength per input variable? How can shortcomings in current partial dependence related measures be mended?<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Michael Mayer is an enthusiastic statistician and R programmer working as non-life pricing actuary for “Die Mobiliar”, one of the most traditional and successful insurance companies in Switzerland. Since finishing his PhD at the University of Bern in 2008, Michael has worked as biostatistician, predictive modeler, statistics consultant as well as University lecturer. He is the author of three CRAN packages.<\/p> ",

The observations may have many features, importantly including labels of reasonably well-defined *stages* of the sales process. Salesfore conveniently exports such observations in easy to analyze form. Viewed through the right kind of lens, models like this look a bit like classical survival models. A friend of mine and I build some nice<br/>models along these lines. The first part of my talk briefly discusses such models.<\/p> <p>Part II<br/>In order to make the models easy to use, we designed a shiny app. In order to make the app available to our clients, at least in beta form, we deployed it with Shinyproxy (and also Docker and Nginx), a tool that makes deploying Shiny apps pretty easy to do. I'll discuss this delightful deployment process in this 2nd part.<\/p> ",

However, there are a dearth of implementations of these models which allow for principled uncertainty estimates, especially in R. This talk will discuss implementing Bayesian Factorization Machines in R and Stan, first introducing basic models, and then, extending these models using techniques from modern hierarchical Bayesian modeling.<\/p> <p>About Adam:<br/>Adam Lauretig is the Senior Data Scientist at JUST Capital, where he works on Bayesian discrete-choice models, ranking methodology, and analyzing survey data. Previously, he completed his Ph.D. in political methodology at The Ohio State University, where he developed Bayesian Word Embeddings to study decision-making American Foreign Policy, and worked on a project with the World Bank, examining the effects of democratization on discrimination in the Indonesian Civil Service.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> ",

While the common heatmap allows us to gain a global view of count data such as gene expression or metabolomic data, it can also be helpful to isolate select observations for visualization in individual plots. This talk will demonstrate automated plotting of gene expression data for each gene in a cellular pathway using a time course dataset. The data visualization package ggplot2 will be used and the function tryCatch() will be implemented to handle possible errors.<\/p> <p>- ***NEW*** All announcements and presentations will be livestreamed and recorded starting at 7:00 PM.

    "description": "<p>Happy New Year to everyone, and welcome to our first meeting of the year, at Coop Bank. Our host, Mart Kaska, has been using R to support anti-money laundering (AML) efforts at the bank. He will give us an overview of the role R plays in his work, and in his talk will discuss how he's worked to support conventional AML analysis with more quantitative insights. In the second talk I'm going to speak about how, and why, to write R applications with a RESTful web API using plumber and Docker.<\/p> <p>Program<br/>------------<\/p> <p>17:30 - Arrival and snacks<br/>18:00 - Introductory remarks by Mart Kaska, Coop Bank<br/>18:15 - Start of presentations (~20m each)<\/p> <p>First talk - Mart Kaska, Data Scientist at Coop Bank, \"How to catch bad guys with R?\"<\/p> <p>Conventional AML analysis relies on analysts' domain knowledge on what kinds of customer transactions are likely to indicate illegal behavior. Mart has been using R to prototype basic quantiative models of fraudulent activity, both in order to test whether it can help analysts prioritize high risk cases, and also to check whether model-based approaches can identify problematic cases conventional analysis misses. As is often the case when expert knowledge meets math, some challenges arise in bridging two very different approaches to AML.<\/p> <p>Second talk - Andreas Beger, Data Scientist at Predictive Heuristics, \"Writing R web APIs with plumber and Docker\"<\/p> <p>Two problems arise when moving from analysis that run on your own laptop to \"live\" functionality in a diverse team: how to allow non-R users to interface with R-based functionality, and second, how to make your code run on someone else's computer (or server). The plumber package provides a solution for the first problem by turning R code and functions into a web application with a RESTful API. Docker is a solution to the second problem by packaging all of this into a container that can be setup anywhere where Docker is installed, regardless of the underlying hardware.<\/p> <p>Logistics<br/>-------------<\/p> <p>The meeting will take place at Coop Bank, Narva mnt 4. This is right next to the Hobujaama tram stops. In case you are driving, there are a small number of free parking spots next to the building. Once inside, go past the turnstiles on the right and up to the 4th floor conference room.<\/p> <p>Snacks and refreshments will be available, and you can bring food if you'd like.<\/p> ",

This talk will delve into why open source software is so important and discuss the role of corporations as stewards of open source software. I'll also talk about how RStudio is structured and organized to pursue its mission of creating open source software for data science.<\/p> <p>J.J. Allaire is a software engineer and entrepreneur who has created a wide variety of products including ColdFusion, Open Live Writer, Lose It!, and RStudio.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>*** Data, visualization, and designing with AI ***<\/p> <p>Recent progress in machine learning has raised a series of urgent questions: How can we train and debug deep learning models? How can we understand what is going on inside a neural network? And, perhaps most important, how can we design systems that serve people best? We'll show a series of examples from the People+AI Research (PAIR) initiative at Google--ranging from data visualizations for researchers, to tools for medical practitioners, to guidelines for designers--that illustrate how thinking carefully about data can lead to better tools, more effective design, and help humans and AI work together.<\/p> <p>Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg are pioneers in data visualization and analytics. Their research has helped shape the field, and the systems they've built are used daily by millions of people. Fernanda and Martin are co-leaders of Google's PAIR (People + AI Research) initiative, which focuses on making AI technology broadly accessible and reflective of human values. Their prior work at Google has appeared on the Google search page, on YouTube, and in mission-critical internal data analytics tools.<\/p> <p>Before joining Google, at IBM Research, the two created the ground-breaking public visualization platform Many Eyes, which introduced visualization to millions of users worldwide. Viégas and Wattenberg are also known for visualization-based artwork, which has been exhibited in venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, London Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Thanks to trivago for hosting &amp; sponsoring this edition of the Düsseldorf R User Group Meetup.

Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must.<\/p> <p>The second edition is updated with the addition of two new chapters, 10 color plates, and a new foreword by renowned geographer H. J. de Blij. One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps.<\/p> <p>To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color.<\/p> <p>\"Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space.\"—Scientific American<\/p> <p>\"A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted. It shows how map makers translate abstract data into eye-catching cartograms, as they are called. It combats cartographic illiteracy. It fights cartophobia. It may even teach you to find your way. For that alone, it seems worthwhile.\"—Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times<\/p> <p>\". . . witty examination of how and why maps lie. [The book] conveys an important message about how statistics of any kind can be manipulated. But it also communicates much of the challenge, aesthetic appeal, and sheer fun of maps. Even those who hated geography in grammar school might well find a new enthusiasm for the subject after reading Monmonier's lively and surprising book.\"—Wilson Library Bulletin<\/p> <p>\"A reading of this book will leave you much better defended against cheap atlases, shoddy journalism, unscrupulous advertisers, predatory special-interest groups, and others who may use or abuse maps at your expense.\"—John Van Pelt, Christian Science Monitor<\/p> <p>\"Monmonier meets his goal admirably. . . . [His] book should be put on every map user's 'must read' list. It is informative and readable . . . a big step forward in helping us to understand how maps can mislead their readers.\"—Jeffrey S. Murray, Canadian Geographic<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Abstract:<br/>Analysing complex sampling -- cluster samples, unequal probabilities, stratification -- used to be a separate and somewhat isolated area of statistics. Some books on the topic might have given the impression it was mostly about the care and feeding of subscripts. In fact, well-conducted complex sampling gives data with important differences from other data sources, but ones whose impact on the analysis is limited. Modern survey analysis software is aimed at reducing the differences to a minimum, so analysts and domain experts can analyse complex surveys correctly in most straightforward cases. I will talk about how you can use the R survey package to do most of the analyses you already do, but with data from complex surveys. ​<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Thomas Lumley is originally from Australia, but worked in Seattle, at the University of Washington, for 12 years. He is currently Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Auckland, where he teaches statistics and data science. Thomas is the developer of the R survey package, and a member of R Core. He has taught workshops on R in 13 time zones.<\/p> ",

Three principal use cases can be identified: consuming a data model, building in-memory or local data models without relying on relational databases, and preparing consistent relational data models for consumption by others. Based on these use cases, he outlines the features of this package and discusses future development. The presentation will be interactive with live coding and a script that attendants can run during or after the presentation.

Hence, there is often a conflict between accuracy and interpretability. We want the most accurate models but don’t want to sacrifice interpretability. In this talk, I discuss this conflict and some new methods in Machine Learning for interpreting ANY predictive model so you do not have to sacrifice predictive accuracy. A package (<a href=\"https://github.com/mt-edwards/xrayspecs\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/mt-edwards/xrayspecs<\/a>) is also introduced that provides these new methods for R programmers.<\/p> ",
