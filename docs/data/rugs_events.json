At the Fall 2019 Amercian Chemical Society National Meeting, two chemistry librarians partnered with a chemistry faculty member to offer a hands-on computer programming workshop. The workshop used the R programming environment, and was structured for beginners with no previous experience with R. Three main topics were covered during the five-hour session: introduction to R, working with QSAR data, and creating a report using R Markdown. This talk will cover the workshop’s logistics, instructional design, and content, and discuss feedback received from participants. Suggestions for future improvements will also be discussed.<\/p> <p>**Talk2** (25min talk, 5min Q&amp;A)<br/>Speaker: Keren Xu<br/>Title: Draw fractals from root finding iteration in R<br/>Abstract: A talk on creating fractals by using root finding methods such as Newton Raphson and Secant method. Root-finding algorithms produce approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. We will write functions with some initial guesses of the root and find better approximations of the root through iterations until the approximation reaches a sufficient precision. The functions can be applied to a complex plane and the starting values that cause the method to converge with the corresponding numbers of iterations will be mapped to draw beautiful fractals.<\/p> <p>**Talk3** (25min talk, 5min Q&amp;A)<br/>Speaker: Luke Morris<br/>Talk title: Bracketball: Let's Explore March Madness with ncaahoopR<br/>Abstract: Whether your interest in college basketball lasts for one month or all year around, the ncaahoopR package can catch you up on the teams or games you care about, and maybe even keep you alive in that office pool a while longer.<\/p> <p>**Code of Conduct**: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>**Schedule**<br/>6:15 open zoom<br/>6:30-7:00 First talk<br/>7:00-7:30 Second talk<br/>7:30-8:00 Third Talk<br/>~8:30 Virtual Social<\/p> <p>**LA R Users Group**<br/>Invite yourself to our Slack group: <a href=\"https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/<\/a><br/>Ask us any questions by email: [masked]<br/>Find our previous talks on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/presentations\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/presentations<\/a><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @la_Rusers<br/>Check out more events: <a href=\"https://laocr.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://laocr.org/<\/a><\/p> <p>***** DON'T BE SHY *******<br/>Reach out if you want to be our speaker.

W ramach prezentacji pokażę, na czym polega modelowanie epidemii i jakie podejścia mogą być tutaj zastosowane. Zaprezentuję podstawowe modele epidemiologiczne oparte o równania różniczkowe oraz ich rozszerzenia. Ponadto przedstawię jak dopasować modele do bieżących danych, korzystając z technik uczenia bayesowskiego. Na koniec pokaże jak z wykorzystaniem tych modeli można prognozować różne scenariusze przebiegu pandemii w zależności od podjętych działań, mających na celu hamowanie jej rozwoju.<\/p> <p>Adam Gonczarek jest współzałożycielem i szefem technologii w Alphamoon, polskiej firmie świadczącej usługi z zakresu sztucznej inteligencji i uczenia maszynowego. Posiada doktorat z informatyki z Politechniki Wrocławskiej, gdzie pracował również jako adiunkt do 2019. Swoje doświadczenie zdobył pracując jako wykonawca, konsultant i lider zespołów AI w projektach B+R i projektach komercyjnych, zarówno dla dużych firm, jak i startupów.<\/p> <p>Sponsorem spotkań i fundacji WhyR? jest firma Kruk S.A.<\/p> ",

They range from ecology and earth observation, through hydrology and soil science, to transportation and demography. These packages support various stages of analysis, including data preparation, visualization, modeling, or communicating the results. One common feature of most R spatial packages is that they are built upon some of the main representations of spatial data in R, available in the sf, sp, raster, terra, or stars package. Those packages are also not entirely independent. They are using external libraries, namely GEOS for spatial data operations, GDAL for reading and writing spatial data, and PROJ for conversions of spatial coordinates.<br/>Therefore, R spatial packages are interwoven with each other and depend partially on external software developments. This has several positives, including the ability to use cutting-edge features and algorithms. On the other hand, it also makes R spatial packages vulnerable to changes in the upstream packages and libraries.<br/>In the first part of the talk, we will showcase several recent advances in R packages. It includes the largest recent change related to the developments in the PROJ library. We will explain why the changes happened and how they impact R users.<br/>The second part will focus on how to prepare for the changes, including computer set-up and running R spatial packages using Docker. We will outline important considerations when setting-up operating systems for geographic R packages. To reduce set-up times you can use geographic R packages Docker, a flexible and scalable technology containerization technology. Docker can run on modern computers and on your browser via services such as Binder, greatly reducing set-up times. Discussing these set-up options, and questions of compatibility between geographic R packages and paradigms such as the tidyverse and data.table, will ensure that after the talk everyone can empower themselves with open source software for geographic data analysis in a powerful and flexible statistical programming environment.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0pB1kG0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0pB1kG0<\/a><\/p> <p>The immense variety of terms, jargon, and acronyms used in medical documents means that named entity recognition of diseases, drugs, procedures, and other clinical entities isn't enough for most real-world healthcare AI applications. For example, knowing that \"renal insufficiency\", \"decreased renal function\" and \"renal failure\" should be mapped to the same code, before using that code as a feature in a patient risk prediction or clinical guidelines recommendation model, is critical to that's model's accuracy. Without it, the training algorithm will see these three terms as three separate features and will severely under-estimate the relevance of this condition.<\/p> <p>This need for entity resolution, also known as entity normalization, is therefore a key requirement from a healthcare NLP library. This webinar explains how Spark NLP for Healthcare addresses this issue by providing trainable, deep-learning-based, clinical entity resolution, as well as pre-trained models for the most commonly used medical terminologies: SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, ICD-10-CM, ICD-10-PCS, and CPT.<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0pB1kG0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0pB1kG0<\/a><\/p> ",

Novel contacts between humans and wildlife, and dense and increasingly mobile human populations all drive risk of pandemics like the one we are living through. I will discuss the data science and analytical challenges in identifying and predicting new emerging diseases and tracking, predicting, and managing COVID-19. I will discuss the R tools used by virus hunters and epidemiologists in addressing these challenges, and lessons that apply to other fields. Finally, I'll discuss ways R users and data scientists can contribute to supporting public health and preventing the next pandemic.<\/p> <p>About Noam:<br/>Noam Ross is Principal Scientist for Computational Science at EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit in NYC that researches the connections between human and wildlife health. Noam builds models to understand and predict disease circulation in wildlife, spillover into people, and spread through travel and trade. Noam also leads software peer review at rOpenSci, a developer collective that builds R packages and catalyzes communities to enable open research and data. He has a Ph.D. in ecology from the University of California-Davis. Follow him on twitter at @noamross.<\/p> <p>Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

Barret Schloerke and Carson Sievert work full time on improving the experience of creating visualizations in R and building Shiny apps. Join them for two talks on new packages that can improve your experience building Shiny apps and data visualizations.<\/p> <p>Schedule:<br/>7 - 7:20pm Reactlog 2.0: Debugging the State of Shiny (Barret)<br/>The revamped reactlog provides an updated visual display to traverse through the reactive behavior within your shiny application. Using live shiny applications, we will use reactlog’s directed dependency graph to find missing reactive dependencies in “working” applications and address suboptimal reactive coding patterns. Correcting these coding patterns will reduce the amount of calculations done by shiny and keep reactive objects from being created unnecessarily.<br/>7:20-7:30 Q+A<br/>7:30-7:50 Plot theming made easieR (Carson)<br/>The new thematic package provides a simplified and uniform approach to theming ggplot2, lattice, and base R graphics based on a few colors and font(s).

Dr. Masood describes one of Magenta's use cases built to reduce customer churn. He will explain the neural network model developed along with the baysian optimization that runs on top to find the best hyper-parameters. Additionally, the concept of shaply values is explained which was used to identify the reasons for churn.<br/>After finishing his PhD in information technology, Dr. Masood joined Magenta Telekom as a data scientist in 2017 and now heads the team as lead data scientist. His interests includes deep neural networks, ensemble trees and baysian optimization techniques. During his employment, he has worked on several use cases including network quality estimation, customer churn and retention, house hold matching, customer lifetime value, propensity modelling for x/up-selling, price to demand analysis, portfolio optimization and many more.<\/p> <p>2. Data Anomalies are a hot topic for many clients spread over all industries. Detecting them is a hot topic for data scientists. As it often comes to the question “What are we actually looking for?”, a first step is towards unsupervised learning.<br/>With mathematical methods like Robust Principle Component Analysis we managed to distinguish anomalies from “usual” data points. Furthermore the detection tool was integrated in a webservice also built with R packages and was lifted into production.<br/>Felix is working for Accenture since 2018 as a Data Scientist. During his mathematics studies he specialized on forecasting, time series analysis and statistics, which also increased his R-Developer Skills. Knowledge in this topics made Felix participating in several machine learning projects at Accenture in public sector as well as financial sector. R as coding language was a central skill in many of those projects.<\/p> <p>Stay at Home and Healthy!<\/p> <p>Greetings,<br/>ViennaR organizers<\/p> ",

In this talk, I’ll cover my experiences with data community building and share strategies from open source communities such as R-Ladies and The Carpentries, as well as the spatial data science community I support at my research center. I’ll discuss the value of the data community builder and their role within / outside of institutions for encouraging uptake of technical tools. Some of the skills needed for these roles may not be what you think: building relationships, being empathetic toward use cases (and users!), organizing events, teaching effectively, and setting strategy for expanding data networks, among others.<\/p> <p>Learner-centered teaching for the non-traditional data science classroom<br/>Katherine Simeon (with Diya Das &amp; Angela Li)<\/p> <p>There is considerable variability in how individuals learn computing skills. While many formal courses, both online and in-person, are available to learners, typical methods of learning are acquiring knowledge on-the-job and participating in short-term workshops. While these non-traditional contexts are highly successful, instructors are challenged to capitalize on a limited amount of time and resources, while catering to learners of different backgrounds and experience levels. In this talk, we will discuss how pedagogic research can be applied to computing &amp; programming education in non-traditional settings (e.g., corporate training, 1-day workshops, and one-on-one mentorship). Specifically, we will explore how to modify established learning formats in order to address specific needs of learners. Finally, we will outline best practices to facilitate a collaborative and inclusive learning environment that can motivate both instructors and learners.<\/p> <p>--------- Schedule ---------<\/p> <p>6:00 - 6:10 -- Announcements &amp; Intros<br/>6:10 - 6:30 -- Angela's Talk on Data Science Communities<br/>6:35 - 6:55 -- Katherine's Talk on Learner-Centered Teaching<\/p> <p>---------------------------------<\/p> <p>Q: Are men welcome to attend this event?<br/>A: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor.

They range from ecology and earth observation, through hydrology and soil science, to transportation and demography. These packages support various stages of analysis, including data preparation, visualization, modeling, or communicating the results. One common feature of most R spatial packages is that they are built upon some of the main representations of spatial data in R, available in the sf, sp, raster, terra, or stars package. Those packages are also not entirely independent. They are using external libraries, namely GEOS for spatial data operations, GDAL for reading and writing spatial data, and PROJ for conversions of spatial coordinates.<br/>Therefore, R spatial packages are interwoven with each other and depend partially on external software developments. This has several positives, including the ability to use cutting-edge features and algorithms. On the other hand, it also makes R spatial packages vulnerable to changes in the upstream packages and libraries.<br/>In the first part of the talk, we will showcase several recent advances in R packages. It includes the largest recent change related to the developments in the PROJ library. We will explain why the changes happened and how they impact R users.<br/>The second part will focus on how to prepare for the changes, including computer set-up and running R spatial packages using Docker. We will outline important considerations when setting-up operating systems for geographic R packages. To reduce set-up times you can use geographic R packages Docker, a flexible and scalable technology containerization technology. Docker can run on modern computers and on your browser via services such as Binder, greatly reducing set-up times. Discussing these set-up options, and questions of compatibility between geographic R packages and paradigms such as the tidyverse and data.table, will ensure that after the talk everyone can empower themselves with open source software for geographic data analysis in a powerful and flexible statistical programming environment.<\/p> <p>Presenters<br/>--------------<br/>Jakub is an assistant professor in the Institute of Geoecology and Geoinformation at the Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland. He is a computational geographer working at the intersection between geocomputation and the environmental sciences. His research has focused on developing and applying spatial methods to broaden our understanding of processes and patterns in the environment. Another vital part of his work is to create, collaborate on, and improve geocomputational software. He is a co-author of the Geocomputation with R book and many R packages, including landscapemetrics, sabre, and climate.<\/p> <p>Robin is associate professor at the Institute for Transport Studies (ITS) and Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA), University of Leeds, UK. His research focuses on geocomputation and reproducible data science for evidence-based policy-making. Decarbonising the global economy while improving health and environmental outcomes is a major problem solving challenge. Robin’s research supports solutions by generating evidence and tools enabling evidence-based investment in efficient and healthy modes of transport at local, city and national scales. Robin is the Lead Developer of the award-winning Propensity to Cycle Tool (see www.pct.bike ), convenor of the Transport Data Science module and workshop series, and co-author of popular packages, papers, and books, including Geocomputation with R.<\/p> ",

Its interface is designed to be both straightforward yet powerful. There are simple functions for those everyday display table needs but also plenty of options for customizability should you need it.<\/p> <p>There is a defined table model that subdivides a table into its component parts. These include the table header, the stub, the column labels and spanner column labels, the table body, and the table footer. All of these parts (and their component cells) can be targeted for the application of styling or the addition of footnotes. With all of the available options, there are many ways to customize the look of your table.<\/p> <p>The best way to get a feel for what gt can do is to take it for a spin, and so we’ll do that through some live demos. I’ll walk you though some code that progressively adds components to a gt table. Table cells will be formatted and, through styling, their appearance will be radically changed. The result in each case will be an HTML table that can be used in a variety of data products.<\/p> <p>**Talk2** (25min talk, 5min Q&amp;A)<br/>Speaker: Avik Das, Software Engineer at LinkedIn<br/>Title: Dynamic programming for machine learning: Hidden Markov Models<br/>Abstract: A Hidden Markov Model deals with inferring the state of a system given some unreliable or ambiguous observations from that system. One important characteristic of this system is the state of the system evolves over time, producing a sequence of observations along the way. By incorporating some domain-specific knowledge, it’s possible to take the observations and work backwards to a maximally plausible ground truth.<\/p> <p>This talk explores Hidden Markov Models in three steps:<\/p> <p>First, I define Hidden Markov Models and how they apply to machine learning problems.<\/p> <p>Next, I build up an understanding of the Viterbi algorithm, used to infer the state of the system given a sequence of observations. This involves some basic math, but the goal is to form an intuition for the algorithm. Some sample Python code is presented to demonstrate how simple the algorithm is.<\/p> <p>Finally, I introduce several real-world applications of Hidden Markov Models in machine learning. In this section, real-world considerations like feature extraction and training are discussed.<\/p> <p>Basic math knowledge is expected, just the ability to express concepts as equations and an understanding of Big-O notation. Basic Python knowledge is helpful, but not required. The goal is build up intuition.<\/p> <p>**Code of Conduct**: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>**Schedule**<br/>6:15 open zoom<br/>6:30-7:00 First talk<br/>7:00-7:30 Second talk<br/>~8:00 Virtual Social<\/p> <p>**LA R Users Group**<br/>Invite yourself to our Slack group: <a href=\"https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/<\/a><br/>Ask us any questions by email: [masked]<br/>Find our previous talks on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/presentations\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/presentations<\/a><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @la_Rusers<br/>Check out more events: <a href=\"https://laocr.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://laocr.org/<\/a><\/p> <p>***** DON'T BE SHY *******<br/>Reach out if you want to be our speaker.

Slack whyr.pl/slack/<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>The focus of this presentation is scalable and automatic machine learning in R using the H2O machine learning platform. H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning platform is designed to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. We will provide a brief overview of the field of Automatic Machine Learning, followed by a detailed look inside H2O's AutoML algorithm. H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface which automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models (including multiple stacked ensemble models for superior model performance), and due to the distributed nature of the H2O platform, H2O AutoML can scale to very large datasets. The result of the AutoML run is a \"leaderboard\" of H2O models which can be easily exported for use in production.<\/p> <p>Biogram:<br/>Dr. LeDell is the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, the company that produces the open source, distributed machine learning platform, H2O. Before joining H2O.ai, she was the Principal Data Scientist at two AI startups (both acquired), the founder of DataScientific, Inc. and a software engineer at a large consulting firm. She received her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley where her research focused on machine learning and computational statistics. She also holds a B.S. and M.A. in Mathematics. Erin has founded Women+ in Machine Learning &amp; Data Science and co-founded R-Ladies Global.<\/p> ",

Only by knowing, who your clients are, you can truly maximize ROI on your marketing campaigns. You will need the profit-driven analytics to help you segment your clients into those segments. Unfortunately, classical Machine Learning (ML) cannot distinguish between those segments. As a result, traditional Machine Learning cannot fully maximize ROI, leaving money on the table. Since, ML models are deployed commonly in banking, telco, retail, etc., it creates the opportunity to improve on that. How? Through making the analytics more profit-driven and employing the most recent &amp; state-of-the-art analytical methods from the intersection of machine learning, causal inference, uplift modelling and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, e.g. Causal Forrest, Generalized Random Forrest, meta-learners, Qini curve, Area under Qini, see Athey, et al. (2019), Chen, et al. (2020), Taddy (2019).<br/>In the presentation, we will demonstrate the example of marketing campaign and show, how we should properly calculate the true profit, i.e. uplift, from our analytical models. We'll present the segmentation of clients into sleeping dogs, sure buyers, lost causes, necessary for ROI maximization. Finally, we will show snippets of R &amp; Python codes implementing these techniques.<\/p> <p>Abstracts<\/p> <p>Mateusz Zawisza - Senior Analytics Advisor to McKinsey &amp; Company<br/>Senior Analytics Advisor to McKinsey &amp; Company with over 10 years of experience in designing &amp; implementing advanced analytics solutions for retail, telecommunication, banking and public sector in Poland and abroad.

Look for the Zoom link to be posted the week of the event!<\/p> <p>The most commonly taught types of regression are linear (where the dependent variable can be any real number) and logistic (where the dependent variable is binary). However, many types of data don't fall into either of these two categories. In this session, we will review regression techniques that can handle other kinds of inputs: censored normal, logit-normal, and beta regression (for dependent variables that are bounded above and/or below); ordered logistic regression (for multiple discrete outcomes that are logically ordered, such as Likert ratings); and multinomial logistic regression (for discrete outcomes that aren't ordered). These techniques provide a better representation of the processes they are modeling and allow us to make more realistic predictions.<\/p> <p>Abby Kaplan is a data scientist at Salt Lake Community College.

Specifically, she is interested in how people perceive what is typical or desirable in a social group, how people make inferences of social information, and how individual differences in these inferences impact judgments and decision makings. She hopes these findings could inform intervention design to nudge people do good. Jinyi is currently working with CSNBD to assess social determinants of sanitation behaviors in India.

This introduction to geospatial data uses location data collected from flatfish and rockfish in southern California to demonstrate how to use RStudio for basic mapping projects. We will discuss the basics of geospatial data, including what shapefiles are and how to read and display them properly in RStudio, as well as how to use RStudio to answer more advanced questions, such as, “What kind of environments are these fish exposed to?” and “Are these fish using areas close to underwater structures, like artificial reefs?” In general, geospatial data can be used to answer a wider variety of questions and RStudio is particularly useful for displaying trends in these data that may be undetectable by simply looking at values within rows and columns.

This month we are excited to welcome Virginia Liu who will be telling us about the development of the Binovisualfields package. This package is for simulation and visualisation of depth-dependent binocular visual fields.<\/p> <p>Visual fields are measured monocularly at a single depth in clinical practice, yet real-life activities involve predominantly binocular vision at multiple depths. A simulation and visualisation tool that computes binocular visual fields from monocular ones is useful for researchers and clinicians in the field for many purposes. However, no such tool was available. The talk will provide an overview of the development of the R package and its CRAN submission process.<\/p> <p>Virginia is a Postdoc researcher at the Optometry and Vision Sciences Department of the University of Melbourne, a self-taught programmer and UX designer.

As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two lenses of knowledge together to take us on “a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical, as clever as it is wise” (Elizabeth Gilbert).<\/p> <p>Drawing on her life as an indigenous scientist, and as a woman, Kimmerer shows how other living beings—asters and goldenrod, strawberries and squash, salamanders, algae, and sweetgrass—offer us gifts and lessons, even if we've forgotten how to hear their voices. In reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning platform is designed to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. We will provide a brief overview of the field of Automatic Machine Learning, followed by a detailed look inside H2O's AutoML algorithm. H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface which automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models (including multiple stacked ensemble models for superior model performance), and due to the distributed nature of the H2O platform, H2O AutoML can scale to very large datasets. The result of the AutoML run is a \"leaderboard\" of H2O models which can be easily exported for use in production.<\/p> <p>Biography<br/>Dr. LeDell is the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, the company that produces the open source, distributed machine learning platform, H2O. Before joining H2O.ai, she was the Principal Data Scientist at two AI startups (both acquired), the founder of DataScientific, Inc. and a software engineer at a large consulting firm. She received her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley where her research focused on machine learning and computational statistics. She also holds a B.S. and M.A. in Mathematics. Erin has founded Women+ in Machine Learning &amp; Data Science and co-founded R-Ladies Global.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>El miércoles 13 de mayo continuamos nuestro taller en línea de introducción a R que organizamos en conjunto RLadies Santiago, RLadies Valparaíso y RLadies Concepción. El taller cuatro sesiones (6, 13, 20 y 27 de mayo) y tiene por objetivo revisar los principios básicos para que puedas iniciar tu camino analizando datos con R.<br/>¿Quieres aprender a utilizar R en un ambiente amable e inclusivo? ¡Te esperamos! No es necesario tener ningún conocimiento previo sobre programación.<\/p> <p>&gt; ¿Qué necesito para participar?<\/p> <p>Lo primero, es leer nuestro nuestro código de conducta. Es requisito para asistir estar de acuerdo con él: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish<\/a><br/>Lo segundo, es crearte una cuenta en RStudio Cloud (<a href=\"https://rstudio.cloud/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.cloud/<\/a>). Partiremos trabajando en una versión de R en la nube para asegurarnos que todo funciona bien al principio. Más adelante instalaremos R en tu computador.<br/>Lo tercero, es asegurarte que puedes utilizar la aplicación Zoom en tu computador. El día del taller te enviaremos el enlace para unirte (chequea ese día que el mensaje no se haya ido a la carpeta de spam).<br/>El taller tiene cupos limitados por la plataforma que usaremos y se asignarán por orden de llegada a las personas inscritas. Te pedimos disculpas desde ya si es que el día del taller tratas de conectarte y los cupos ya están llenos :( Es muy difícil estimar la audiencia real en eventos gratuitos.<\/p> <p>&gt; ¿Al inscribirme ahora me estoy anotando para las cuatro sesiones?<\/p> <p>No. Agendaremos un nuevo evento acá en Meetup para cada sesión. Lo hacemos así porque nos permite organizarnos mejor.<\/p> <p>¡Te esperamos!<\/p> ",
