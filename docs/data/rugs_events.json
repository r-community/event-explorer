    "description": "<p>**Talk**<\/p> <p>Shiny is arguably the most popular framework among data scientists for building advanced data apps. Once you build the Shiny application two questions loom: how to keep the input data up-to-date, and where to host it. The answers are often related. For example, if your data is in an on-premise database, you cannot host your app in the cloud. As data grows and changes, keeping the input to the application becomes more challenging. I have seen many enterprise users, implementing a two-step architecture. They run regular batch jobs to fetch and summarize data from their data lake or data warehouse into a staging environment. The Shiny app, then, loads staged data and presents advanced analytics to end-users.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I will show how you can use Apache Spark and the Delta Lake open source projects in your Shiny applications to directly load data from the Lake House. I will discuss how such a unified approach can remove several \"moving parts\" and simplify your work. I will present what the Lake House architecture is, and how R programs can interact with the Lake House using SparkR or sparkly. I will also demo examples of interactively developing and hosting simple Shiny apps that access large data on Databricks.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: Hossein Falaki<\/p> <p>Currently, I am a staff software engineer at Databricks. I joined Databricks in December 2013 as one of the first software engineers. As an early employee, I had the opportunity to wear different hats including development, product management, data science, and field engineering. I have been presenting my work at leading industry conferences.<\/p> <p>As a software engineer, in addition to regular software development responsibilities, I championed and implemented several key features in Databricks product and contributed to Apache Spark. These include integration with third-party visualization libraries, end-to-end implementation of R Notebooks, integration with SparkR, integration with sparklyr, programmable input widgets, and data ingest UI. I also made several contributions to Apache Spark open-source project, including the CSV data source.<\/p> <p>As a founding member of the data science team, I built our first usage monitoring dashboards using our product and performed several deep dives and advanced analyses on topics of interest to the executive team.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http://www.falaki.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.falaki.net/<\/a><\/p> <p>**Schedule**<br/>6:20 Open zoom<br/>6:30-7:30 Presentation<br/>~7:30 Virtual Social<\/p> <p>**Code of Conduct**: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>**LA R Users Group**<br/>Invite yourself to our Slack group: <a href=\"https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/<\/a><br/>Ask us any questions by email: [masked]<br/>Find our previous talks on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/presentations\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/presentations<\/a><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @la_Rusers<br/>Check out more events: <a href=\"https://socalr.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://socalr.org/<\/a><\/p> <p>***** DON'T BE SHY *******<br/>Reach out if you want to be our speaker.

This second workshop will introduce participants to mixed models, which are otherwise known as multilevel models or sometimes also hierarchical linear models. These models are crucial for dealing with cases of non-independence, such as when multiple data points are collected from the same individual, or from the same school, district, institution, country, or any other grouping variable. After a brief conceptual introduction, the workshop gives a quick tutorial on how to use the lme4 and afex packages to fit a generalized linear mixed effects model in R.<\/p> <p>Please feel welcomed even if you didn’t make it to the first session as Bodo will begin with a very quick recap of part one anyway.<\/p> <p>In case you want to see what was covered in part one, here is a link to a recording of the first session: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/35CwxVz\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/35CwxVz<\/a><\/p> <p>A repo with access to the hands-on materials will be distributed closer to the date of the workshop.<\/p> ",

So how do you get your R scripts to run? In this talk I hope to inspire lone data scientists on all the ways you can run your Rscript in the cloud. I cover some simple and more advanced use cases for running R in the cloud. I also talk about cooperating with IT for maximum results.<\/p> <p># Speaker<br/>I'm a maker, I love to build useful (machine learning) tools for people and I love sharing what I learned.

    "description": "<p>Data Science for (gender) equality<\/p> <p>In this talk I will discuss the role of artificial intelligence in precision Despite improvements, women in STEM are still facing more challenges than their male colleagues: they earn less, more likely to leave their tech job being, and their work receives less acknowledgment. These disparities persist, despite evidence that integrated female members increase the overall intelligence of teams and gender heterogeneous teams are more creative and productive. Recent years' scandals in the tech industry brought attention to women’s marginalization in STEM. In my talk, I will showcase large-scale data-driven studies from my research to illustrate that increasing the number of women itself will not solve the problem. On examples from open source software engineering, video game development, and organizational collaborations I will describe why we should not focus only on diversity and how data science can help to fight against unconscious bias.<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://x-europe-ds-for-equality.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://x-europe-ds-for-equality.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Orsolya Vasarhelyi, PhD<br/>Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Warwick<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/orsolya-vasarhelyi-43132925/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/orsolya-vasarhelyi-43132925/<\/a><\/p> <p>Orsolya Vasarhelyi, Ph.D. is a data scientist, educator, and public speaker.

The formula syntax is very similar to that of the lme4 package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p># Speaker<\/p> <p>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany).

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<br/><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

I will also share my journey in creating my own personal website and show some examples of how to customize it to make it unique.<\/p> <p>Bio: Cristal is an Industrial Production Engineer from Costa Rica, working in advanced analytics for Thermo Fisher Scientific. Her journey in R began two years ago, doing data analysis, modeling and applications with shiny. Cristal's background is in urban logistics researching, supply chain, and business intelligence analysis, and is an active member of volunteer communities in Costa Rica to learn and teach data science in an inclusive, accessible, and inspiring way to be able to be a promoter community in the area hand in hand with volunteering educational.<\/p> <p>Maria Kamenetsky's Abstract: Many learners are often intimidated by entering a statistics or programming course and may even ask for what topics they can review in advance. While recommending textbooks is helpful, learners limited in time may not be able to review that much material. In this talk, I will briefly present the learnr package and how it can be used as a self-assessment tool to help learners efficiently review course material.<\/p> <p>Bio: Maria is a PhD candidate in Epidemiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her research focus is in spatial epidemiology, specifically developing statistical methods for spatial and spatio-temporal cluster detection and estimation. She completed her MS in Statistics at UW-Madison, where she also works as a Project Assistant (Statistical Consultant) with the CALS Statistical Consulting Lab.<\/p> ",

We're back in February with part 2 of the Generalized Linear Models workshop by Bodo Winter.<\/p> <p>In part one, Bodo Winter gave an introduction to linear models and generalized linear models. This second workshop will introduce participants to mixed models, which are otherwise known as multilevel models or sometimes also hierarchical linear models. These models are crucial for dealing with cases of non-independence, such as when multiple data points are collected from the same individual, or from the same school, district, institution, country, or any other grouping variable. After a brief conceptual introduction, the workshop gives a quick tutorial on how to use the lme4 and afex packages to fit a generalized linear mixed effects model in R.<\/p> <p>Please feel welcomed even if you didn’t make it to the first session as Bodo will begin with a very quick recap of part one anyway.<\/p> <p>In case you want to see what was covered in part one, here is a link to a recording of the first session: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/35CwxVz\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/35CwxVz<\/a><\/p> <p>A repo with access to the hands-on materials will be distributed closer to the date of the workshop.<\/p> ",

He received his master's and PhD from Gyeongsang National University, Korea, in 2021, where he studied the role of autophagy in development and disease. He used R/Bioconductor to analyze gene expression and transcription data from mice models. He wrote open-source R packages to distribute the data, methods, and code of my research<\/p> <p>Description of the workshop :<br/>Researchers use ChIP binding data to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. They use gene expression data from sequencing or microarrays to quantify the effect of the factor over-expression or knockdown on its targets. The integration of the binding and expression data therefore can be used to improve the understanding of a transcription factor function. In this workshop, I present a complete workflow for integrating the gene expression (microarray/RNA-seq) and DNA-binding data (ChIP-seq) to predict the combined function of two transcription factors using R/Bioconductor. The example we will be using in the workshop is from real datasets of two functionally and evolutionary related transcription factors YY1 and YY2 in HeLa cells. We will try to identify the factor-specific and the shared targets of the factors in this particular cell line. Then we will use a technique find out the aggregate functions of the factors on their individual (inducer or repressor) and common targets (cooperative or competitive).<\/p> <p>More details about the workshop are provided through this link <a href=\"https://mahshaaban.github.io/IntegratingDataBioc/\" class=\"linkified\">https://mahshaaban.github.io/IntegratingDataBioc/<\/a><\/p> <p>In order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉 <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y7kzasq7\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/y7kzasq7<\/a><\/p> <p>We will send you the Zoom link and the enter passcode a few hours before the training session.

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>My list of publications can also give you the big picture of my research activities:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

A partire da una lunga e approfondita esperienza di lavoro a stretto contatto con le persone, in piccoli e grandi gruppi e organizzazioni, e dalle diverse culture e generazioni, Nancy Cooklin, coach, counselor e formatrice, ha creato un modello chiamato “Human Leadership”.<\/p> <p>In questo momento più che mai l’aspetto “Human” è diventato centrale sia nella vita professionale che in quella personale. La chiave sta nell'essere focalizzati e forti emotivamente. In questo modello ci sono 4 aree tra le quali Nancy ci guiderà: consapevolezza, creatività, coraggio e pensiero sistemico.<br/>Avere chiarezza su chi siamo e cosa ci guida accresce la nostra autostima e ci permette di relazionarci in modo autentico e coerente con chi siamo e cosa vogliamo.<\/p> <p>Dopo questo workshop:<\/p> <p>- Ti sentirai più allineata o concentrata così da saper prendere decisioni più facilmente.<br/>- Prederai consapevolezza delle leve che ti portano ad agire<br/>- Capirai come funziona il meccanismo del cambiamento e perché a volte cambiare è più difficile che non cambiare<br/>- Riconoscerai l’importanza della tua storia per andare verso il futuro più libera di fare le tue scelte<br/>- Saprai comunicare con gli altri in modo efficace<br/>- Capirai l’importanza dell’autenticità nel mondo di oggi, sia a livello personale che professionale<\/p> <p>Le persone ti scelgono per quello che sei, non per quello che fai!<\/p> <p>Ci vediamo presto!<\/p> ",

In addition to demonstrating how to go from R Markdown to web-based slides with xaringan, in this talk I'll show you how to completely customize the appearance of your slides with xaringanthemer, a package that lets you quickly create a complete slide theme from only a few color choices. Then we'll go beyond appearances with a variety of addins and extensions from the xaringanExtra package, including: a tiled slide overview, editable slides, embedded webcam videos, tabbed panels, extra styles, shareable and embeddable slides, animations, and real time slide broadcasting.<\/p> <p>About Garrick:<br/>Garrick Aden-Buie is a Data Science Educator at RStudio and lives in sunny St. Petersburg, Florida. His passion is to combine creative coding with programming education, using code to build tools that teach coding to new and advanced R users alike. Like tidyexplain: a project that used ggplot2 and gganimate to reimagine database operations as colorful flying boxes instead of the typical Venn diagrams. Garrick has developed a number of open source addins and packages for RStudio—such as regexplain, shrtcts and rsthemes—and is always easily distracted by projects that combine R Markdown and online learning or teaching.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EST and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before.

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>Amal Saadallah works as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). Her main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining, also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>Her list of publications can also give you the big picture of her research activities:<br/><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>R-Ladies Toolbox Series - Essentials for women and minority genders in academia, science and data analysis presents:<\/p> <p>Reproducibility by Charles Grey (R-Ladies Remote)<\/p> <p>Talk Abstract:<br/>As scientists, it's desirable to demonstrate to others (including our future selves) that our computational scientific work validates the claims we make in published research. Being able to reproduce the work is a key component of easily validating an analysis, as well as extending the work. Reproducibility is not as simple, however, as sharing the code and data that produced our analysis. We must consider how our data and algorithms are understood, variables defined, etc. Our code needs to be accessible and interoperable. There is much guidance about best practice, but this is often overwhelming for those of us who are not from formal computer science training. In this talk I share the story of how I attempted good enough practice in my doctoral thesis, and found even this was simply too much to achieve. Indeed, despite failing to achieve good enough scientific practice in any aspect of reproducibility, I discovered a delightful world of scientific workflows in R that make every day just that bit easier now. Failing at reproducible science in R is the best we can aim for; we will never achieve best practice in every aspect of reproducibility, and if we failed, then we tried. Through this process we discover useful tools to make the next time easier.<\/p> <p>BIO:<br/>Charles T. Gray is a postdoc with the evidence synthesis lab at Newcastle University. She is currently specialising in Bayesian network meta-analysis in Cochrane intervention reviews. She has three degrees: arts, music, and mathematics. None of these prepared her for her interdisciplinary computational metascience doctoral thesis in R.<\/p> <p>Calling all students, academics, and women in science! R-Ladies Freiburg presents a five-part guest series aimed at women and gender minorities in academia, science and data analysis, from first semester students to tenured researchers. Leading R-Ladies from around the world will lead us through the most fundamental steps to studying and working in academia, from analyzing results, to presenting them clearly, ensuring their reproducibility, and keeping track of all your changes. The series will close with a panel discussion from women around the world, who will speak about their experiences with science.<\/p> <p>This series is funded by the “Pädagogische Hochschule Freiburg”, the University of Education in Freiburg.<\/p> <p>Participants who take part in all five meetups can receive a certificate of participation.<\/p> <p>Everyone is welcome to join and we hope for a warm exchange between students and researchers, as well as R-Ladies from the wider community.<\/p> ",

This second workshop will introduce participants to mixed models, which are otherwise known as multilevel models or sometimes also hierarchical linear models. These models are crucial for dealing with cases of non-independence, such as when multiple data points are collected from the same individual, or from the same school, district, institution, country, or any other grouping variable. After a brief conceptual introduction, the workshop gives a quick tutorial on how to use the lme4 and afex packages to fit a generalized linear mixed effects model in R.<\/p> <p>Please feel welcomed even if you didn’t make it to the first session as Bodo will begin with a very quick recap of part one anyway.<\/p> <p>In case you want to see what was covered in part one, here is a link to a recording of the first session: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/35CwxVz\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/35CwxVz<\/a><\/p> <p>A repo with access to the hands-on materials will be distributed closer to the date of the workshop.<\/p> ",

    "start": "2021-03-04",
    "description": "<p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Both complex and dynamic evolving nature of time series data make forecasting among one of the most important and challenging tasks in time series analysis. Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>My list of publications can also give you the big picture of my research activities:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hi, everybody!<br/>We hope that you and your family are doing well. We are super excited to have Jill de Ron, PhD student at the psychological methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA) to bring you a workshop on Network analysis in R!<\/p> <p>DESCRIPTION<br/>-------------------<br/>We can use networks to provide insights into a variety of settings: A network connecting our Facebook friends gains understanding in our social structure; a human contact network gains insight into disease transmission; and a network of public transport lines informs us about the most central subway stations. In these examples, the relationships between components in the network are known. But in a lot of other cases, the relationships between components are unknown and are what we are interested in. For example, when we want to investigate the relationships between different personality traits. Network psychometrics makes it possible to estimate relationships between a large number of variables. Once you estimated a network, you can perform network-based statistics that give you information about the network’s local and global characteristics. In this workshop, you will learn how to estimate, analyze and interpret (psychological) network models. After a short introduction to network models, we will follow by a tutorial on analyzing data with network models.<\/p> <p>PROGRAMME<br/>----------------------<br/>18.30- 18.45 Virtual Welcome<br/>18.45- 20.30 Workshop and Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>ABOUT JILL<br/>-------------------<br/>I am a PhD student at the psychological methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA). My research is concerned with computational models of anxiety disorders and (formal) theory construction in psychology. I have a master’s degree in both Behavioral Data Science and Psychology. During my master programs I have been teaching assistant for the network analysis course at the UvA.<\/p> <p>PREREQUISITES<br/>-----------------------<br/>A basic knowledge of R is recommended. To join the tutorial, please install the bootnet package and the qgraph package.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct. Anyone who violates this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, meetup membership or other condition. We are emphatically queer and trans-friendly. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn.<\/p> ",

You may have come across this when trying to interpret a residual plot from a logistic regression. For discrete data, these are not really artefacts, they are properties of the distribution of the data, like mean-variance relationships and lots of zeros. Generalised linear models and their extensions model the distribution of the data, including these properties, and so are a good way to remove them, to better see the patterns we are actually interested in. I will talk though some concepts and lots of examples of how we can use models to get the best out of our visualisations of discrete multivariate data in R.<\/p> <p>Biography: Gordana is a statistical consultant and research fellow at UNSW Sydney, with research interests in modelling and visualising multivariate discrete data in ecology. In her spare time, Gordana can be found hiking or ocean swimming (poorly but enthusiastically).<\/p> <p>Website link: <a href=\"https://statsoc.org.au/event-4144562?CalendarViewType=1&amp;SelectedDate=2/15/2021\" class=\"linkified\">https://statsoc.org.au/event-4144562?CalendarViewType=1&amp;SelectedDate=2/15/2021<\/a><\/p> ",

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>My list of publications can also give you the big picture of my research activities:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

Brittany will guide us through a beginner-level tutorial on how and why to use parallel computing in R.<\/p> <p>Brittany is a Research Associate (Postdoc) at the Oregon IPM Center at Oregon State University, where she is developing a spatial modeling platform (written in R) that predicts phenology and climate suitability of invasive insect species in real-time. She is broadly interested in how environmental perturbations such as climate change shape the population dynamics and geographical range limits of plant and animal species.<\/p> <p>In her demo, she will demonstrate the use and value of the parallel, doParallel, and foreach packages for parallel computing in R. The demo will center on analyzing very large spatial data sets, but parallel processing in R can be used for ANY type of data. She will provide examples of when you may want to use parallel computing for your work, and provide further resources to explore.<\/p> <p>This demo will be held over zoom and we will RStudio Cloud so you can follow along with the Brittany's code. We will email out instructions on what to expect and how to get set up.<\/p> <p>~~How to follow Brittany’s tutorial:~~<\/p> <p>**Recommended** Option 1: Create a free RStudio Cloud account and join Brittany’s shared workspace using the link below. This will create a copy of Brittany’s R project for you and allow to run her code. The advantage of using RStudio Cloud is that all of the packages you will need are pre-installed and you’ll be working from the same settings as Brittany. This will make it much easier for us to help you if you run into any problems.<br/><a href=\"https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/119389/join?access_code=412mjNHj6%2BJmLjN24nM8Px6UDtq7qILJh%2B064Io2\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/119389/join?access_code=412mjNHj6%2BJmLjN24nM8Px6UDtq7qILJh%2B064Io2<\/a><\/p> <p>Option 2: If you don’t want to use RStudio Cloud, you can clone Brittany’s repo.

Here is one explanation:<\/p> <p>We often have collections of documents, such as blog posts or news articles, that we’d like to divide into natural groups so that we can understand them separately. Topic modeling is a method for unsupervised classification of such documents, similar to clustering on numeric data, which finds natural groups of items even when we’re not sure what we’re looking for.<\/p> <p>Please remember to RSVP or you won't be able to get the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Hope you can make it!<\/p> <p>Ray<\/p> ",

À ce titre, la Data Science a fait son entrée dans le monde médical par l'intermédiaire d'algorithmes de Machine Learning et de Deep Learning ainsi que des méthodes d'analyse statistique. Un réseau bayésien est un modèle probabiliste utilisé pour représenter les relations de dépendance conditionnelle (et dans certains cas de causalité) entre différentes variables. Souvent oubliée par la communauté scientifique lors de l'analyse de données, cette méthode présente pourtant de nombreux avantages qui peuvent se révéler être des atouts de taille pour l'analyse de données médicales<\/p> ",

Pavitra will introduce the gt package and show how you can easily create beautiful, presentation-ready tables with a few simple lines of code. As a bonus. we will kick off the event with an informative lightning talk about classification and regression trees given by Praveena Matthews!<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Lightning talk title: Classification and Regression Trees<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Praveena Mathews teaches R for GraduateTutor.com. She is also the founder of R-Ladies Chennai.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Using the `gt` package to create presentation-ready tables<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: Tables are sometimes treated like the step-children of the Vizworld. An after-thought or as place-holders for numbers. For me, tables are the sexiest visualizations in the Viz world; a good table conveys more to me through its simplicity than the sometimes confusing array of colors, shapes and sizes of a plot.<\/p> <p>Bio: I am a data engineer at Converging Health who is a also a bench-trained PhD scientist. I use enterprise tools in my day job; don’t hold that against me.

A partire da una lunga e approfondita esperienza di lavoro a stretto contatto con le persone, in piccoli e grandi gruppi e organizzazioni, e dalle diverse culture e generazioni, Nancy Cooklin, coach, counselor e formatrice, ha creato un modello chiamato “Human Leadership”.<\/p> <p>In questo momento più che mai l’aspetto “Human” è diventato centrale sia nella vita professionale che in quella personale. La chiave sta nell'essere focalizzati e forti emotivamente. In questo modello ci sono 4 aree tra le quali Nancy ci guiderà: consapevolezza, creatività, coraggio e pensiero sistemico.<br/>Avere chiarezza su chi siamo e cosa ci guida accresce la nostra autostima e ci permette di relazionarci in modo autentico e coerente con chi siamo e cosa vogliamo.<\/p> <p>Dopo questo workshop:<br/>- Ti sentirai più allineata o concentrata così da saper prendere decisioni più facilmente.<br/>- Prederai consapevolezza delle leve che ti portano ad agire<br/>- Capirai come funziona il meccanismo del cambiamento e perché a volte cambiare è più difficile che non cambiare<br/>- Riconoscerai l’importanza della tua storia per andare verso il futuro più libera di fare le tue scelte<br/>- Saprai comunicare con gli altri in modo efficace<br/>- Capirai l’importanza dell’autenticità nel mondo di oggi, sia a livello personale che professionale<\/p> <p>Le persone ti scelgono per quello che sei, non per quello che fai!<\/p> <p>Ci vediamo presto!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>LA R Users Group will have our March meeting online on Zoom (<a href=\"https://usc.zoom.us/j/92828963940\" class=\"linkified\">https://usc.zoom.us/j/92828963940<\/a>).<\/p> <p>**Talk 1**<\/p> <p>In this talk, attendees will get an introduction to writing command-line interfaces in R. The talk begins with a discussion of fundamental command-line topics like managing output streams, exit codes, and environment variables. After that, the talk will explain each argument to the \"Rscript\" executable. The talk will then describe how to write your own R programs that take in command-line arguments, using builtin functions like `commandArgs()` and external packages like {argparse} and {crayon}. The talk concludes with a demo of two R command-line interfaces used in the {lightgbm} project: one for running linting with {lintr} in continuous integration and one for building a C++ library using CMake. Sample code will be available on GitHub prior to and following the talk.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: James Lamb<\/p> <p>James Lamb is an engineer at Saturn Cloud, where he works on a team building a managed Dask + Kubernetes product. He is a maintainer on {lightgbm}, and has made many contributions to other open source data science projects, including {xgboost} and prefect. He is also a maintainer and co-author of two other packages on CRAN: {pkgnet} and {uptasticsearch}. He holds masters degrees in Applied Economics (2014) and Data Science (2018). Before joining Saturn, he worked as an IoT Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services and Uptake.<\/p> <p>**Talk 2**<\/p> <p>While working remotely, I often have client projects where RStudio is unavailable for data security reasons or otherwise. R is feature-rich environment for terminal users as well, and I will discuss the underappreciated<br/>functions around highlighting, graphics, editor integration, and other nice-to-haves for day-to-day<br/>usage of the terminal.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: Neal Fultz<\/p> <p>Neal Fultz is a long-time friend of the LA RUG/Tech community.

It is a weekend-long event.<\/p> <p>During this event, we will be exploring an interesting data set, starting from the raw data all the way through to a final \"end product\" (e.g. a data visualization, an interesting data insight, a predictive model, etc.).<\/p> <p>This event is open to all experience levels, from the complete beginner to the highly experienced. Participants will work in teams to \"hack\" through the data and will present their work at the end of the event for prizes. You are free to create your own team, or we will assist in team creation if you do not have one. This is a great way to network, share, and learn from others.<\/p> <p>The main goal of the hackathon is to promote teamwork and foster education and learning in a welcoming environment. Though teams will be competing to present their best work at the end of the event for prizes, communication and providing assistance across teams is highly encouraged. We will provide in-person training during the hackathon and online training prior to the event.<\/p> <p>We have set up a GitHub repository that has more information about the hackathon. Such as the schedule; setting up slack and much more. Further information will be provided prior to the event.<\/p> <p>All participants must abide by the OCRUG Code of Conduct and R Consortium Code of Conduct.<\/p> <p>This will be an online event.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Are you looking to improve our R skills? Come just us for a book club. It will be headed up by John Peach. The idea is to motivate us to read books and discussing them together. This will help all of us to develop our skills.<\/p> <p>The format will be that the leader will prepare a short summary of the material and present it to the group. We will then discuss the material and do some exercises.<\/p> <p>The expectations are that you will attend regularly. If you cannot make a commitment to attend, please wait until the next book club starts. It is also expected that participants will take turns being the leader. The leader should prepare a summary of the material that was read and present it to the group.<\/p> <p>We will meet each week, Monday evening between 6:30 and 8:00 PM for six weeks.<\/p> <p>Book: Title: Text Mining with R<br/>Online: <a href=\"https://www.tidytextmining.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tidytextmining.com/<\/a><br/>Dead Tree: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491981652/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491981652/<\/a><\/p> <p>Signing up: When you sign-up you will be placed on the waiting list.

I am a conscientious person who works hard and pays<br/>attention to detail. Experienced in interpreting and analysing data to drive the growth of the company. I am an<br/>effective communicator with excellent interpersonal relationship and management skills. My greatest strength is strong<br/>analytical thinking, which enables me to furnish insights, analyse data, build machine learning and deep learning<br/>models to leverage business to guide their decisions. I am also experienced in coordinating with stakeholders. I<br/>create content on YouTube to help others in the data science field; I am a qualified gym instructor and personal trainer.<\/p> <p>### Talk: Data Optimisation Network<br/>The Data Optimisation Network (DON) seeks to improve business decision-making using machine intelligence and data science<br/>techniques. It predicts customer behaviour through data-driven insights to enable the business to acquire new customers<br/>intelligently. The key problem with most of the companies is not just to acquire more customers, but it is to acquire the right customers and retain them. Companies consider the cost of customer acquisition as an important measure in evaluating how much value a customer will bring to their businesses. DON will empower teams such as Customer Value<br/>Management, Marketing, Sales, Continuous Improvement and more via interactive dashboards available in real-time.<br/>These dashboards will enable research, and the understanding of market trends and behaviours. The demonstration of the app is based on the utility sector. However, the data is anonymised for the solution but depicts the real-life problem.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event is kindly sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

They can be used to identify popular topics among different legislators, reveal party factions that do not show up in voting behaviour, and longitudinal<br/>changes in the language used to discuss certain topics, amongst other things.

    "description": "<p>Speaker: Dr. Krisztian Magori<\/p> <p>Title: Using R to analyze and model COVID-19 cases<\/p> <p>Abstract: Many years from now, we will all think back to what we were doing during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how we contributed to resolving it. In my presentation, I will show you three small projects I conducted related to the pandemic, and look for your feedback. First, I analyzed COVID-19 case trends across the State of Washington, particularly in Spokane, in order for myself to see behind daily case counts, and still looking for ways to expand that. Second, I tested the oft-heard suggestion that increased case numbers in the fall of 2020 were simply due to increased testing, using bootstrapping methods. Finally, I developed a stochastic, spatially explicit model to simulate COVID-19 transmission within a facility, such as a dorm, with visualization conducted in R.<\/p> <p>Speaker Profile: Krisztian Magori,Ph.D., is a Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Department of Biology at Eastern Washington University. He teaches biostatistics using R at both the undergraduate and graduate level, and consults with faculty and students on statistical analysis of their datasets. In addition, he is a disease ecologist, focusing on ticks and mosquitoes, when we don't have a pandemic that's more important.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>In R we can do a lot with data tables. There are plenty of ways to import tabular data and then transform it for our needs. Lately, there’s been an explosion of new R packages that allow us to take these data tables and make them presentable in publication contexts. A package Rich Iannone has been working on, called gt, is great for taking a data frame and making it look good (and more like a table you’d find on the web or in print). Rich will show us some examples of how the gt package works, where it works well, and where other packages might do better for specific needs. This introduction will help prepare you to try out gt and some of the other table-making packages in the R ecosystem.<\/p> <p>All skill levels are welcomed!<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30pm - 6:40pm Introductions<br/>6:40pm - 7:20pm Turning Data Frames into Publication Ready Tables with Rich Iannone<br/>7:20pm - 7:30pm Closing Remarks<\/p> <p>(Topic presentations sometimes run longer than 40 minutes)<\/p> <p>This meetup will be a virtual event, so join us over video chat.

Please see event details below:<br/>----------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Alastair Rushworth (Tesco Bank)<\/p> <p>Title: Exploring EDA with R<\/p> <p>Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (aka EDA) is one of the most important tools in the data scientist’s toolkit, while also being one of the hardest to codify and teach. EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modelling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk). Since completing his PhD in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London in 2011, Matthew has worked in technical and non-technical roles in academia, the commercial sector, and the public sector - with a focus on managing diverse stakeholders and developing data-driven products and solutions.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Alastair Rushworth (Tesco Bank)<\/p> <p>Title: Exploring EDA with R<\/p> <p>Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (aka EDA) is one of the most important tools in the data scientist’s toolkit, while also being one of the hardest to codify and teach. EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modelling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk). Since completing his PhD in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London in 2011, Matthew has worked in technical and non-technical roles in academia, the commercial sector, and the public sector - with a focus on managing diverse stakeholders and developing data-driven products and solutions.<\/p> ",

We continue our meetups with #goodRvibes and a speaker you'll definitely enjoy!<\/p> <p>Three reasons to use tidymodels with Julia Silge<\/p> <p>Modeling and machine learning in R involve a bewildering array of heterogeneous packages, and establishing good statistical practice is challenging in any language. The tidymodels (tidymodels.org) collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, we’ll focus on three specific reasons to consider using tidymodels. We will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering.<\/p> <p>Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC where she works on open source modeling tools. She is an author, an international keynote speaker, and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice. Julia loves text analysis, making beautiful charts, and communicating about technical topics with diverse audiences.<\/p> <p>Registration is free, but mandatory via meetup.

She received her Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles. Her area of expertise includes design of experiments, statistical methods and applications, survey methods, and discrete choice experiments. Her recent projects include the development of a new class of experimental designs that provide higher efficiency, more in-depth analyses, and require a shorter time to run. This research has led to multiple interdisciplinary funded projects.<\/p> <p>Abstract: As science and technology progress, this often calls for innovation in methodological and theoretical development of statistical experimental design, an essential aspect for research in any discipline. This research concentrates on the close connection between statistics and medicine, and the development of novel experiments to maximize efficiency, while minimizing time and costs. The focus of this talk will be on an application of an undergraduate research project using a novel experimental design known as an Orthogonal Array Composite Design (OACD) with applications to KB oral cancer. In particular, this talk will highlight the methods and applications that undergraduate students contributed to. Furthermore, various takeaways will be presented in terms of tips, challenges, and benefits in working with undergraduate students. sources.<\/p> <p># Modernizing Design of Experiment Output with Tidyverse<br/>Speaker: Jose Toledo<br/>Graduate Student, Statistics Dept, CSU Fullerton<\/p> <p>Bio: Jose is currently in his last semester in the Master’s in statistics program at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), where he is also a teaching associate. Additionally, he is a part-time data analyst at Southern California Coast Water Project. His research interest is in the field of Design of Experiments, where he has worked on projects such as drug combination treatments for KB oral cancer and recently in tuberculosis. During his summer breaks he enjoys mentoring undergraduate students in local community colleges and providing them research opportunities early in their education.<\/p> <p>Abstract: Most Design of Experiment (DoE) experts will agree that using FrF2 is the most comprehensive R package for generating two-level factorial designs as well as Plackett-Burman type screening designs. Similarly, for sequential optimization with first order and second order response surface models, that offer optimization approaches like steepest ascent and visualization of the response function for linear model objects, the package rsm is highly recommended. However, their graphical outputs are limited and can benefit from the current “trends” in R such as implementing graphics using ggplot2. This talk will focus on the development of an R package, ggDoE, which focuses on the visualization of DoE using ggplot2. Examples will be taken from a TB drug combination experiment and demonstrate the output of commonly used methods in DoE. These methods include but are not limited to: factorial effect plots, half-normal plots, Lenth’s method, fitting second-order models and their corresponding contour plots.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

The range of functionalities has expanded and some very interesting extensions have been created. There is the officedown package that increases the layout capabilities of R Markdown when the output is Word, the rvg package to create editable vector graphics, the flextable package to make nice tables.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, you will see how to use the package to produce PowerPoint presentations and Word documents. Its role as a foundation for other packages and new documentation will be discussed. It will also be an opportunity for David to present the officedown package for the first time.<\/p> <p>## Speaker<\/p> <p>David Gohel is the founder of ArData, a French company providing R expertise, R training and consulting in data sciences. He is the author of R packages, most popular are officer, flextable, rvg and ggiraph.<\/p> <p>He is a data scientist and software engineer. His professional experiences led him to face many challenges related to the data of organizations, which he has always managed with solutions involving R software.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hi, everybody!<br/>We hope that you and your family are doing well. We are super excited to have Nutsa Nanuashvili, a data enthusiast that recently graduated in Cognitive Sciences to introduce you to the tidyverse universe!<\/p> <p>DESCRIPTION<br/>-------------------<br/>The goal of this workshop is to get familiar with some useful and easy to use data transformation techniques in R. For this, we are going to go through some handy functions and commands from the famous tidyverse ecosystem. Hopefully with these tricks and tips you’re going to get more confident around transforming &amp; organizing data.<br/>During the meeting we will discuss some concepts and provide code examples, after which we’ll go through exercises to try out the newly learned concepts by ourselves. Some of the topics we’ll cover are, tidy data concept, reshaping datasets, what is and how to use the pipe %&gt;% operator, and manipulating data columns and rows.<br/>For all these we're going to use the dataset about penguins from palmerpenguins package.<\/p> <p>PROGRAMME<br/>----------------------<br/>18.30- 18.45 Virtual Welcome<br/>18.45- 20.30 Workshop and Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>ABOUT NUTSA<br/>-------------------<br/>I recently graduated with a master’s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Amsterdam, Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies. I love programming and working on data. I especially love coding in R and I used it a lot while doing my master's projects. While looking for new adventures, I enjoy working on data and learning new concepts as part of my side-projects.<\/p> <p>PREREQUISITES<br/>-----------------------<br/>A basic knowledge of R is recommended. Please install the tidyverse package.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct. Anyone who violates this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, meetup membership or other condition. We are emphatically queer and trans-friendly. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn.<\/p> ",

His work focuses on mapping rural resilience in Scotland and understanding how policy impacts community resilience. Elliot’s research also looks at how information on sustainable agriculture practices is shared between farmers and how this influences behaviour change related to sustainable development.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Do people with Type 1 Diabetes talk and tweet about the same things?<\/p> <p>### Mirjam Eiswirth<br/>In this presentation I explore ways of comparing a set of transcribed conversational data with a set of data from Twitter. I specifically look at 24 hours of recordings of talk about Type 1 Diabetes relative to Tweets within the context of the diabetes online community. This comparison allows us to assess how representative the concerns raised in the conversations are of the world-wide discourses around Type 1 Diabetes on English-language Twitter, and in how far they are specific to the participants or to the location these participants are from.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Does it have to look like a 90’s website? Introduction to CSS and HTML for styling interactive outputs in R<\/p> <p>### Elliot Meador<\/p> <p>In this talk we will review some easy wins when it comes to styling interactive outputs in R, including Shiny web applications and flexdashboards. Specifically, we’ll discuss Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and how they can be used to add some pizazz to the base Shiny and flexdashboards. We will then discuss layouts and workflows that are best suited for styling your interactive R outputs.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>/federico<\/p> ",

It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.<\/p> <p>Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”<\/p> <p>Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed..<\/p> <p>PS This book is available free online: <a href=\"https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/<\/a><\/p> ",

It predicts customer behaviour through data driven insights to enable business to acquire new customer intelligently. Main Key problem with most of the companies is not just to acquire more customers but it is to acquire the right customers and retain them. Companies consider the cost of customer acquisition as an important measure in evaluating how much value a customer will bring to their businesses. DON will empower teams such as Customer Value Management, Marketing, Sales, Continuous Improvement and more via interactive dashboards available in real time. These dashboards will enable research and the understanding of market trends and behaviours. The demonstration of the app is based on utility sector. However, the data is anonymised for the solution but depicts the real life problem.<\/p> <p>Biography: Process oriented Data Scientist with 9 years of experience.

EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modelling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk). Since completing his PhD in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London in 2011, Matthew has worked in technical and non-technical roles in academia, the commercial sector, and the public sector - with a focus on managing diverse stakeholders and developing data-driven products and solutions.<\/p> ",

The range of functionalities has expanded and some very interesting extensions have been created. There is the officedown package that increases the layout capabilities of R Markdown when the output is Word, the rvg package to create editable vector graphics, the flextable package to make nice tables.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, you will see how to use the package to produce PowerPoint presentations and Word documents. Its role as a foundation for other packages and new documentation will be discussed. It will also be an opportunity for David to present the officedown package for the first time.<\/p> <p>## Speaker<\/p> <p>David Gohel is the founder of ArData, a French company providing R expertise, R training and consulting in data sciences. He is the author of R packages, most popular are officer, flextable, rvg and ggiraph.<\/p> <p>He is a data scientist and software engineer. His professional experiences led him to face many challenges related to the data of organizations, which he has always managed with solutions involving R software.<\/p> ",

They can be used to identify popular topics among different legislators, reveal party factions that do not show up in voting behaviour, and longitudinal changes in the language used to discuss certain topics, amongst other things. In this webinar I'll discuss some approaches and potential pitfalls to analysing legislative debate, using the British House of Commons as an example.<\/p> <p>Biography: Evan Odell is a junior data consultant at Pandata and R programmer, based in Berlin. Evan has written numerous R packages, primarily for accessing and processing data, and created a dataset of UK House of Commons speeches available as a single RDS or CSV file.

    "description": "<p>Alastair Rushworth (Tesco Bank)<\/p> <p>Title: Exploring EDA with R<\/p> <p>Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (aka EDA) is one of the most important tools in the data scientist’s toolkit, while also being one of the hardest to codify and teach. EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modeling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk). Since completing his PhD in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London in 2011, Matthew has worked in technical and non-technical roles in academia, the commercial sector, and the public sector - with a focus on managing diverse stakeholders and developing data-driven products and solutions.<\/p> ",
