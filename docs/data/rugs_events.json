Recent years brought a great turnover in terms of using Shiny in production, thanks to the advances of tools like RStudio Connect. That makes Shiny a perfect choice for both scientific and business applications.<\/p> <p>In this tutorial, I will walk you through the basics of Shiny apps development. We will create our first functional interactive data dashboard, we will learn about good development practices, deployment to shinyapps.io and alternative UI components (shiny.semantic).<\/p> <p>This workshop will assume a basic knowledge of R, (particularly tidyverse and ggplot) and HTML. Workshop materials are courtesy of Appsilon.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Dominik Krzemiński - computational neuroscience PhD student working at the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre. He works as well for the Appsilon Data Science as an Open Source Tech Lead. Long-time member of Cardiff R User Group. Dominik is interested in neuroscience and machine-learning, particularly decision making. He is passionate about reproducible research and interactive data visualisations.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/dokatox\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/dokatox<\/a><\/p> ",

Challenges seeker and devoted R language enthusiast. In the past, keen on the field of large-scale online learning and various approaches to personalized news article recommendation.<br/>Community events host: organizer of Why R? conferences whyr.pl. Interested in R packages development and survival analysis models. Currently explores and improves methods for quantitative marketing analyses and global surveys at Gradient Metrics.<\/p> <p>TOPIC<br/>Subscriptions are no longer just for newspapers. The consumer product landscape, particularly among e-commerce firms, includes a bevy of subscription-based business models. Internet and mobile phone subscriptions are now commonplace and joining the ranks are dietary supplements, meals, clothing, cosmetics and personal grooming products.<\/p> <p>Standard metrics to diagnose a healthy consumer-brand relationship typically include customer purchase frequency and ultimately, retention of the customer demonstrated by regular purchases. If a brand notices that a customer isn’t purchasing, it may consider targeting the customer with discount offers or deploying a tailored messaging campaign in the hope that the customer will return and not “churn”.<\/p> <p>The churn diagnosis, however, becomes more complicated for subscription-based products, many of which offer multiple delivery frequencies and the ability to pause a subscription. Brands with subscription-based products need to have some reliable measure of churn propensity so they can further isolate the factors that lead to churn and preemptively identify at-risk customers.<\/p> <p>During the presentation I’ll show how to analyze churn propensity for products with multiple states, such as different subscription cadences or a paused subscription. If the time allows I’ll also present useful plots that provide deep insights during such modeling, that we have developed at Gradient Metrics - a quantitative marketing agency<\/p> ",

These powerful function approximators typically require large amounts of data to be trained, which poses a challenge in the usual case where little labeled data is available. During the last year, multiple solutions have been proposed to leverage this problem, based on the concept of self-supervised learning, which can be understood as a specific case of unsupervised learning. This talk will cover its basic principles and provide examples in the field of multimedia.<\/p> <p>ABOUT SPEAKER<br/>Be ready for a long and interesting list of experiences, titles, and recognitions that our guest Xavier has.<\/p> <p>Xavier Giro-i-Nieto is an associate professor at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona as a member of the Intelligent Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research Center (IDEAI-UPC) and Image Processing Group (GPI), and also a visiting researcher at Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). He graduated in Telecommunications Engineering at ETSETB (UPC) in 2000, after completing his master thesis on image compression at the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels (VUB) with Prof. Peter Schelkens. After working one year in Sony Brussels, he started a Ph.D. on computer vision, supervised by Prof. Ferran Marqués. In parallel, he designed and taught courses at the ESEIAAT (video content delivery) and ETSETB (deep learning) schools at UPC, as well as the Master in Computer Vision of Barcelona (video analysis). He visited multiple times the Digital Video and MultiMedia laboratory directed by Prof. Shih-Fu Chang at Columbia University in New York between[masked], with whom he keeps collaborating. He also works closely with the Insight Center of Data Analytics at Dublin City University and his industrial partners at Vilynx, Mediapro, and Crisalix. He serves as associate editor at IEEE Transactions in Multimedia and reviews for top tier conferences in machine learning (NeurIPS, ICML), computer vision (CVPR, ECCV, ICCV), and multimedia (ACMMM, ICMR).<\/p> <p>FORMAT<br/>This is a joint online event of Vienna Data Science Group, Frankfurt Data Science, Budapest Data Science Meetup, BCN Analytics, Budapest.AI, Barcelona Data Science and Machine Learning Meetup, Budapest Deep Learning Reading Seminar and Warsaw R Users Group.<\/p> ",

In this talk we will learn how to query databases and return the results as an R data frame. We will show how packages like DBI and dbplyr allow us to use dplyr syntax to run queries against a database and return the results. This allows us to keep our workflow entirely within R, instead of switching contexts between SQL and R. After looking at a few examples, we will cover some tips for incorporating these ideas into our daily work as well as resources for moving beyond the basics.<\/p> <p>Talk #2: Asmae Toumi, favorite packages for missing data in R:<\/p> <p>Asmae Toumi will give a very broad overview of how to leverage the {naniar} package to explore and visualize missing data, identify patterns of missing data, and impute missing data using the {MICE} package.<\/p> <p>Talk #3: Amanda Hart &amp; Amanda Meli, Tips &amp; tricks for making your own R package:<\/p> <p>From plotting to analysis, packages are foundational tools for R users. But what happens when there isn’t an existing package to meet your needs? In this talk, we will learn how to take your own code and turn it into a new R package. We will provide simple steps to get started and tips to add features as you become package-building experts.<\/p> <p>Talk #4: Juliana Capitanio, Flexdashboards: Using interactive dashboards to create data visualizations<\/p> <p>Juliana Capitanio will show us how to use R Markdown to quickly create a dashboard using the flexdashboards package. These dashboards can compile plots, tables, gauges, value boxes, text annotations and maps into various layouts. Dashboard components are responsive and quickly resize to fit mobile devices. Further, we can easily make dashboard elements interactive by using htmlwidgets for R and/or Shiny.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0shHhB0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0shHhB0<\/a><\/p> <p>Artificial intelligence projects in high-compliance industries, like healthcare and life science, often require processing Protected Health Information (PHI). This may happen because the nature of the projects does not allow full de-identification in advance – for example, when dealing with rare diseases, genetic sequencing data, identify theft, or training de-identification models – or when training is anonymized data but inference must happen on data with PHI.<\/p> <p>In such scenarios, the alternative is to create an “AI cleanroom” – an isolated, hardened, air-gap environment where the work happens. Such a software platform should enable data scientists to log into the cleanroom, and do all the development work inside it – from initial data exploration &amp; experimentation to model deployment &amp; operations – while no data, computation, or generated assets ever leave the cleanroom.<\/p> <p>This webinar presents the architecture of such a Cleanroom AI Platform, which has been actively used by Fortune 500 companies for the past three years. Second, it will survey the hundreds of DevOps &amp; SecOps features requires to realize such a platform – from multi-factor authentication and point-to-point encryption to vulnerability scanning and network isolation. Third, it will explain how a Kubernetes-based architecture enables “Cleanroom AI” without giving up on the main benefits of cloud computing: elasticity, scalability, turnkey deployment, and a fully managed environment.<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0shHhB0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0shHhB0<\/a><\/p> ",

Should the event become fully booked and you are not able to register, please head over to Botswana RUG meetup page (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Botswana-R-Users/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Botswana-R-Users/<\/a>) or RLadies Johannesburg (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/rladies-johannesburg/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/rladies-johannesburg/<\/a>) if you are a woman and minority gender as they will also be hosting with us.<\/p> <p>Please note: We are opening up *15* spots and we will be choosing **8** from them who will attend the workshop. The others will be wait-listed in the event someone drops off the attendees list.<\/p> <p>Description:<br/>Have you ever struggled to re-run your own code or scripts you received from a collaborator? You're not alone! Fortunately, there are simple practices that you can use to help you develop more reproducible R code. In this tutorial, you will 1) explore some of the common causes of non-reproducible code, 2) gain practical experience fixing reproducibility issues, and 3) use the R package workflowr (<a href=\"https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/<\/a>) to facilitate creation of more reproducible and shareable code. The tutorial will be hands-on and interactive, with small-group exercises.<\/p> <p>Prerequisites:<br/>Participants should have some experience using R (e.g. importing data from a file, loading a package). The tutorial will involve running R code in R Markdown files from the RStudio IDE. If you are unfamiliar with R Markdown, we recommend reviewing these short guides before participating in the tutorial:<br/>[Introduction](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html<\/a>),<br/>[How It Works](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html<\/a>),<br/>[Code Chunks](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html<\/a>].<\/p> <p>*Requirements:*<br/>A web browser, an account on GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/<\/a>), and an account on RStudio Cloud (<a href=\"https://rstudio.cloud/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.cloud/<\/a>). We will email you the tutorial materials.<\/p> <p>Instructors:<br/>Dr. John Blischak received his PhD in Genetics from the University of Chicago. He is the author of the CRAN package workflowr, and has years of experience performing reproducible data analysis with R, R Markdown, and Git. He is a certified Software Carpentry Instructor, and has taught over 10 workshops for researchers covering topics such as Bash, Python, R, and Git. He co-authored the tutorial published in PLoS Computational Biology, A quick introduction to version control with Git and GitHub. Lastly, he has taught the workflowr framework in a live workshop setting four times.<\/p> <p>Dr. Peter Carbonetto, a co-author of the workflowr R package, is a research staff scientist in the Human Genetics Department and the cross-disciplinary Research Computing Center at the University of Chicago. He has a background in computer science and machine learning, and currently does research at the interface of genetics, statistics, and computer science. He frequently gives R and bioinformatics skills workshops at the University of Chicago.<\/p> <p>It will be an online meetup, and the link will be sent to successful attendees via email.<\/p> <p>All Information: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2WqAfNy\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2WqAfNy<\/a><\/p> ",

This month we have Colin Fay from France.<\/p> <p>Due to COVID-19 the meetup will take place entirely online. Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Our annual R Conference in New York is also virtual-only. We have an excellent lineup including Max Kuhn, Erin LeDell, Rob Hyndman, Jacqueline Nolis and Andrew Gelman. There are also two-days of workshops covering Machine Learning with tidymodels, git, Shiny, web scraping, GIS &amp; Mapping, EDA with the tidyverse and even scikit-learn.

Use code NerdsLovePizza at <a href=\"https://www.scottspizzatours.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.scottspizzatours.com/<\/a> for the discount.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>You've probably already heard that \"Everything not tested will eventually fail\", or read that \"If you're not writing unit tests, your users are the unit tests\"... As extreme as they might sound, these quotes reveal one of the most important things when it comes to production-software: testing should be done as extensively as possible. Most R developers are already familiar with standard package testing, but things can get a little bit different when it comes to interactive web applications: what do we test, why, and how? In this talk, Colin will start by developing the good practices when it comes to testing Shiny, and present some of the tools you can use to test your own applications.<\/p> <p>About Colin:<br/>Colin Fay works at ThinkR, a French agency Focused on everything R-related. During the day, he helps companies to take full advantage of the power of R, by providing training, tools and infrastructure. His main areas of expertise are data &amp; software engineering, back-end &amp; infrastructure, and R in production. During the night, Colin is also a hyperactive open source developer and an open data advocate. You can find a lot of his work on his GitHub account (<a href=\"https://github.com/ColinFay\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/ColinFay<\/a>) and on ThinkR's account (<a href=\"https://github.com/thinkr-open\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/thinkr-open<\/a>). He is also active in the Data Science community in France, and an international speaker.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 6 and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>The RLadies chapters and the R User Group from Chile are very happy to announce that we will be hosting one of the useR! 2020 online tutorials (<a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/<\/a>). We will have the honor of having Dirk Eddelbuettel in our meetup, who will be running the tutorial: \"Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp\" on July 14th, 15:00 UTC.<\/p> <p>- Background<\/p> <p>R has risen to become the lingua franca of statistical research and applications. At the same time, user demands on computing resources and performance have also increased. This is driven chiefly by the ever-growing size of datasets, and may sometimes be coupled with increases in their complexity. The quest for computing with larger datasets, as well as the ever-present desire to also compute \"faster\" make complementing the interpreted language-processing at the core of R with native code extensions a natural next step. The Rcpp package has become the principal venue for extending R with compiled code. It makes it easy to extend R with C or C++ spanning the range from simple one-liners to larger routines and bindings of entire external libraries.<\/p> <p>- Workshop contents<\/p> <p>We will motivate and introduce Rcpp as a natural extension to R that provides an easy-to-use and powerful interface. Helper functions and tools including RStudio will be used to easy creation of R extensions. Several examples will introduce basic use cases including writing code with RcppArmadillo which is the most widely-used package on top of Rcpp.<\/p> <p>- Target Audience<\/p> <p>R users wanting to go beyond R. Prior experience with compiled languages like C and C++ is helpful but not required.<\/p> <p>- About the instructor<\/p> <p>Dr Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a (co-)author and maintainer for the Rcpp project since its inception. He works as a senior \"quant\" in industry combining C++ and R for high-frequency data analysis and predictive models in finance, and teaches a class on Data Science Programming Methods as a Clinical Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is author, co-author, or maintainer of sixty CRAN packages, an elected board member of the R Foundation, and a 25+ year contributor to Debian looking after 150+ packages including R.<\/p> <p>- Attending the workshop<\/p> <p>Please, read carefully the useR! 2020 Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/<\/a>.

    "description": "<p>Marketers often use A/B testing as a tool to compare marketing treatments in a test stage and then deploy the better-performing treatment to the remainder of the consumer population. These tests have traditionally been analyzed using hypothesis testing, which Elea covered in a previous R Ladies workshop. In this workshop, Elea and Ron will explain a new approach to A/B testing that they developed called \"Test &amp; Roll\" that focuses on the profit earned during and after the test. It is based on a Bayesian decision theory and the (very technical) Test &amp; Roll paper explains why marketers should use this approach. This workshop will focus on how to Test &amp; Roll using hands-on examples in R. Elea and Ron will cover:<\/p> <p>- When you should use \"Test &amp; Roll\" versus traditional hypothesis test<br/>- How to compute the Test &amp; Roll sample size that maximizes profits<br/>- How to estimate priors from your own data to help plan your Test &amp; Roll<br/>- How to analyze a Test &amp; Roll experiment (It's easy!)<\/p> <p>All you need to participate are basic R skills; we'll explain the rest. All code and data will be available via Github. Participants should install R, the rstan package and RStudio prior to the workshop.<\/p> <p>Speakers:<br/>- Elea McDonnell Feit is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the LeBow College of Business at Drexel University. She develops data analysis methods to inform marketing decisions including designing new products as well as planning advertising campaigns.<\/p> <p>- Ron Berman is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania.

Com ele é possível simular cenários para a epidemia considerando diferentes formas de intervenção para seu manejo e diferentes combinações para os parâmetros que regem sua evolução. Uma das ideias do simulador é permitir que o usuário interaja com essas questões e entenda um pouco da complexidade e da incerteza associadas a essas projeções.

    "title": "R-Ladies Valparaíso: useR! 2020 Tutorial: Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp",
    "group": "R-Ladies Valparaíso",
    "start": "2020-07-14",
    "description": "<p>The RLadies chapters and the R User Group from Chile are very happy to announce that we will be hosting one of the useR! 2020 online tutorials (<a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/<\/a>). We will have the honor of having Dirk Eddelbuettel in our meetup, who will be running the tutorial: \"Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp\" on July 14th, 15:00 UTC.<\/p> <p>- Background<\/p> <p>R has risen to become the lingua franca of statistical research and applications. At the same time, user demands on computing resources and performance have also increased. This is driven chiefly by the ever-growing size of datasets, and may sometimes be coupled with increases in their complexity. The quest for computing with larger datasets, as well as the ever-present desire to also compute \"faster\" make complementing the interpreted language-processing at the core of R with native code extensions a natural next step. The Rcpp package has become the principal venue for extending R with compiled code. It makes it easy to extend R with C or C++ spanning the range from simple one-liners to larger routines and bindings of entire external libraries.<\/p> <p>- Workshop contents<\/p> <p>We will motivate and introduce Rcpp as a natural extension to R that provides an easy-to-use and powerful interface. Helper functions and tools including RStudio will be used to easy creation of R extensions. Several examples will introduce basic use cases including writing code with RcppArmadillo which is the most widely-used package on top of Rcpp.<\/p> <p>- Target Audience<\/p> <p>R users wanting to go beyond R. Prior experience with compiled languages like C and C++ is helpful but not required.<\/p> <p>- About the instructor<\/p> <p>Dr Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a (co-)author and maintainer for the Rcpp project since its inception. He works as a senior \"quant\" in industry combining C++ and R for high-frequency data analysis and predictive models in finance, and teaches a class on Data Science Programming Methods as a Clinical Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is author, co-author, or maintainer of sixty CRAN packages, an elected board member of the R Foundation, and a 25+ year contributor to Debian looking after 150+ packages including R.<\/p> <p>- Attending the workshop<\/p> <p>Please, read carefully the useR! 2020 Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/<\/a>. All participants are required to agree to it.<\/p> <p>The tutorial will start at 15:OO UTC and has a duration of two hours (+ a 10 minutes break). Check your timezone here: <a href=\"https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2020-07-14/15:00/Seamless%20R%20and%20C%2B%2B%20integration%20with%20Rcpp\" class=\"linkified\">https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2020-07-14/15:00/Seamless%20R%20and%20C%2B%2B%20integration%20with%20Rcpp<\/a><\/p> <p>[UPDATED SECTION]<\/p> <p>We'll be hosting the tutorial on Zoom. The link will be shared in the comments of this event half an hour in advanced. The meeting has a waiting room. We'll let everyone in at 15:00 UTC.<\/p> <p>For the tutorial you'll need to install Rcpp from CRAN. You will also need a compiler. Please read sections 1.2 and 1.3 on the second page of the Rcpp FAQ to check specific recommendations for Windows/OSX/Linux users: <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf<\/a><br/>We'll be using RStudio. Is not a bad idea to have an rstudio.cloud account as back-up.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hey everyone,<\/p> <p>As most of you know, UseR! 2020 is happening online this year. Further, this year the conference tutorials will be done in partnership with R-Ladies Global, MiR, and the AfricaR user group.<\/p> <p>The AWESOME news is that our group, R-Ladies San Diego, has been chosen to host one of the UseR! tutorials this year! We are really excited to bring this opportunity to our members and to other R enthusiasts from all over the world!<\/p> <p>The tutorial we are hosting will be presented by disk.frame creator Zhuo Jia Dai (ZJ). He'll tell us more about \"Easy Larger-than-RAM data manipulation with disk.frame\".<\/p> <p>Here's ZJ's description: In this tutorial, we will present the {disk.frame} (diskframe.com) R package for handling datasets that are too large for RAM but still fits comfortably on your hard drive. We will go through how {disk.frame} works, how to manipulate ten's of gigabytes of data without using all your RAM, and how you can take advantage of the many CPU cores on your computer by parallelizing data manipulation task using {disk.frame}. Also, I will show you how to perform all the standard data manipulations by using just dplyr verbs! After the tutorial, you should be able to confidently tackle dataset up to ten's of gigabytes in size comfortably on your laptop.<\/p> <p>I really hope you can all make it to our very first online event. This is such an amazing opportunity for all of us! Hopefully useR! 2020 will allow many that might not have been able to attend such a conference in person to join us in our exploration of the R universe.<\/p> <p>We really look forward to (virtually) seeing everyone again soon!<\/p> <p>Your R-Ladies SD organizers<\/p> ",

In this talk we will learn how to query databases and return the results as an R data frame. We will show how packages like DBI and dbplyr allow us to use dplyr syntax to run queries against a database and return the results. This allows us to keep our workflow entirely within R, instead of switching contexts between SQL and R. After looking at a few examples, we will cover some tips for incorporating these ideas into our daily work as well as resources for moving beyond the basics.<\/p> <p>Talk #2: Asmae Toumi, naniar package:<\/p> <p>Asmae Toumi will give a very broad overview of how to leverage the {naniar} package to explore and visualize missing data, identify patterns of missing data, and impute missing data using the {MICE} package.<\/p> <p>Talk #3: Amanda Hart, Tips &amp; tricks for making your own R package:<\/p> <p>From plotting to analysis, packages are foundational tools for R users. But what happens when there isn’t an existing package to meet your needs? In this talk, we will learn how to take your own code and turn it into a new R package. We will provide simple steps to get started and tips to add features as you become package-building experts.<\/p> <p>Talk #4: Juliana Capitanio, Flexdashboards: Using interactive dashboards to create data visualizations<\/p> <p>Juliana Capitanio will show us how to use R Markdown to quickly create a dashboard using the flexdashboards package. These dashboards can compile plots, tables, gauges, value boxes, text annotations and maps into various layouts. Dashboard components are responsive and quickly resize to fit mobile devices.

You’re not alone! Fortunately, there are simple practices that you can use to help you develop more reproducible R code. In this tutorial, you will 1) explore some of the common causes of non-reproducible code, 2) gain practical experience fixing reproducibility issues, and 3) use the R package workflowr (<a href=\"https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/<\/a>) to facilitate creation of more reproducible and shareable code. The tutorial will be hands-on and interactive, with small-group exercises.<\/p> <p>Prerequisites:<br/>Participants should have some experience using R (e.g. importing data from a file, loading a package). The tutorial will involve running R code in R Markdown files from the RStudio IDE. If you are unfamiliar with R Markdown, we recommend reviewing these short guides before participating in the tutorial: [Introduction](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html<\/a>), [How It Works](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html<\/a>), [Code Chunks](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html<\/a>].<\/p> <p>Requirements:<br/>A web browser, an account on GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/<\/a>), and an account on RStudio Cloud (<a href=\"https://rstudio.cloud/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.cloud/<\/a>). We will email you the tutorial materials.<\/p> <p>Instructors:<br/>Dr. John Blischak received his PhD in Genetics from the University of Chicago. He is the author of the CRAN package workflowr, and has years of experience performing reproducible data analysis with R, R Markdown, and Git. He is a certified Software Carpentry Instructor, and has taught over 10 workshops for researchers covering topics such as Bash, Python, R, and Git.<\/p> <p>Dr. Peter Carbonetto, a co-author of the workflowr R package, is a research staff scientist in the Human Genetics Department and the cross-disciplinary Research Computing Center at the University of Chicago. He has a background in computer science and machine learning, and currently does research at the interface of genetics, statistics, and computer science.

In this talk, I will discuss two studies used to test this theory for weight loss maintenance, including an observational study using data from Reddit and a randomized controlled experiment using an Amazon Mechanical Turk population. I will also discuss R methods used to parse through semi-structured data, perform regression analyses and hypothesis tests, and visualize results.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Elicia John is a Behavioral Data Scientist.

Using tracking data, each route can be described as a sequence of spatial-temporal measurements that varies in length depending on the duration of the play. This data can be conveniently analyzed using nested columns in tidyr and purrr. We demonstrate how model-based curve clustering using Bernstein polynomial basis functions (i.e. Bézier curves) fit using the Expectation Maximization algorithm can cluster route trajectories. Each cluster can then be labelled to obtain route names for each route and create route trees for all receivers. The clusters and routes can be visualized nicely using ggplot and seen developing over time using gganimate.<\/p> <p>R + Tidyverse in Sports - Namita Nandakumar<br/>This talk will use a case study, most likely in hockey, to showcase the many ways in which R and the Tidyverse can be used to analyze sports data as well as the unique priorities and considerations that are involved in applying statistical tools to sports problems.<\/p> ",

See bottom of post for important logistical details.<\/p> <p>Description: In both data science and academic research, prediction modeling is often not enough; to answer many questions, we need to approach them causally.

    "group": "R-Ladies Concepción",
    "start": "2020-07-14",
    "description": "<p>The RLadies chapters and the R User Group from Chile are very happy to announce that we will be hosting one of the useR! 2020 online tutorials (<a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/<\/a>). We will have the honor of having Dirk Eddelbuettel in our meetup, who will be running the tutorial: \"Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp\" on July 14th, 15:00 UTC.<\/p> <p>- Background<\/p> <p>R has risen to become the lingua franca of statistical research and applications. At the same time, user demands on computing resources and performance have also increased. This is driven chiefly by the ever-growing size of datasets, and may sometimes be coupled with increases in their complexity. The quest for computing with larger datasets, as well as the ever-present desire to also compute \"faster\" make complementing the interpreted language-processing at the core of R with native code extensions a natural next step. The Rcpp package has become the principal venue for extending R with compiled code. It makes it easy to extend R with C or C++ spanning the range from simple one-liners to larger routines and bindings of entire external libraries.<\/p> <p>- Workshop contents<\/p> <p>We will motivate and introduce Rcpp as a natural extension to R that provides an easy-to-use and powerful interface. Helper functions and tools including RStudio will be used to easy creation of R extensions. Several examples will introduce basic use cases including writing code with RcppArmadillo which is the most widely-used package on top of Rcpp.<\/p> <p>- Target Audience<\/p> <p>R users wanting to go beyond R. Prior experience with compiled languages like C and C++ is helpful but not required.<\/p> <p>- About the instructor<\/p> <p>Dr Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a (co-)author and maintainer for the Rcpp project since its inception. He works as a senior \"quant\" in industry combining C++ and R for high-frequency data analysis and predictive models in finance, and teaches a class on Data Science Programming Methods as a Clinical Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is author, co-author, or maintainer of sixty CRAN packages, an elected board member of the R Foundation, and a 25+ year contributor to Debian looking after 150+ packages including R.<\/p> <p>- Attending the workshop<\/p> <p>Please, read carefully the useR! 2020 Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/<\/a>. All participants are required to agree to it.<\/p> <p>The tutorial will start at 15:OO UTC and has a duration of two hours (+ a 10 minutes break). Check your timezone here: <a href=\"https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2020-07-14/15:00/Seamless%20R%20and%20C%2B%2B%20integration%20with%20Rcpp\" class=\"linkified\">https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2020-07-14/15:00/Seamless%20R%20and%20C%2B%2B%20integration%20with%20Rcpp<\/a><\/p> <p>[UPDATED SECTION]<\/p> <p>We'll be hosting the tutorial on Zoom. The link will be shared in the comments of this event half an hour in advanced. The meeting has a waiting room. We'll let everyone in at 15:00 UTC.<\/p> <p>For the tutorial you'll need to install Rcpp from CRAN. You will also need a compiler. Please read sections 1.2 and 1.3 on the second page of the Rcpp FAQ to check specific recommendations for Windows/OSX/Linux users: <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf<\/a>.<\/p> <p>We'll be using RStudio.

Here is my proposal:<\/p> <p>- Gather a small group of 2-5 and learn together.<br/>- Meet at a coffee shop, library, or some other space that has Wi-Fi.<br/>- Pick a project, data set or problem, then work to solve it with different tools.<br/>- Keep it fluid and informal.<br/>- Meet on a regular basis, say weekly to start, and adjust as needed.<br/>- Aim to keep the meetings 2-4 hours long, but this can be adjusted to the project or group. People can come and go as needed.<br/>- It does not have to be the same people each time, so you only have to commit to going once to check it out.<\/p> <p>Are you interested? Show up at the meeting spot, have some coffee, meet new friends and bring a project or question.<\/p> ",

The Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Often the gap between data science and software or data engineering can make setting up R environments properly a challenge; you can spend weeks of coordination to get your data science project code into production. Docker can be used to containerize your R code projects and make the transition between development code into production a cinch. This talk will cover some basics in Docker commands and demonstrate how to set up containers for Rscript batch processing and R plumber APIs.<\/p> <p>Mark Nielsen is currently a Data Scientist at Intermountain Healthcare and is leading the development of ML Engineering pipelines for better implementation of machine learning into patient and caregiver workflows.<\/p> ",

Quali strumenti o piattaforme di sviluppo diventeranno obsolete durante il prossimo anno?*<\/p> <p>Abbiamo deciso di supportare il nuovo questionario Developer Economics survey Q2 2020 per avere delle risposte.<br/>Il questionario è molto chiaro e diretto al sodo. Condividi le tue opinioni su i più popolari strumenti di sviluppo, piattaforme, tecnologie e framework. Cosa ti piace usare? Cosa hai provato ma poi subito abbandonato perché non abbastanza intuitivo, o cosa vorresti conoscere meglio?<\/p> <p>Rispondi a queste domande per aiutarci a scoprire cosa manca sul mercato. Il questionario è aperto solo a sviluppatori e data scientists, ma invita tutti a partecipare: studenti, professionisti, e coloro che si dilettano per hobby. I risultati saranno disponibili in autunno e pubblicati nel nuovo State of the Developer Nation (disponibile gratuitamente per tutti!). Qui avrai grafici e informazioni su trend globali che potrai utilizzare per avere un quadro più amplio e aggiornato del mercato.<\/p> <p>Coloro che si registrano e completano il questionario parteciperanno automaticamente all'estrazione di uno dei premi in palio. Il montepremi ammonta a +15 mila $, e sono inclusi premi tipo iPhone 11, Oculus Quest 64GB, JetBrains All Product Pack, Corsair Mechanical Gaming keyboard, Cloud Guru license, più una serie di gadgets e accessori, e vouchers Amazon. Sei pronto per una sfida? Ci sono altri 1000 $ in cash come premio se spargi la voce e altri sviluppatori partecipano al questionario.<\/p> <p>Un'altra cosa che è veramente importante è che per ogni questionario completato, doneremo $0.10 a Techfugees per supportare e aiutare gli sviluppatori di domani.<\/p> <p>Il questionario è aperto fino al 10 agosto, non perdere quest'occasione!<br/>I risultati del sondaggio sono ciò su cui si basa l'intero ecosistema per creare nuovi strumenti, piattaforme che saranno utilizzate in futuro da voi sviluppatori.<\/p> <p>Fallo per R-Ladies Bari. Se arriviamo ad un numero di risposte valide otterremo dei fondi da investire in un progetto congiunto tra RLadies Bari e RLadies Milano.<\/p> <p>Inizia qui 🚀<br/><a href=\"https://developereconomics.net?member_id=rladies_italy&amp;lang=en\" class=\"linkified\">https://developereconomics.net?member_id=rladies_italy&amp;lang=en<\/a><\/p> ",

The workshops cover machine learning in both R and Python, web scraping, shiny, GIS, git and the tidyverse. Speakers include Andrew Gelman, Emily Dodwell, Jon Krohn, Emily Robinson, Wes McKinney, Ludmila Janda, David Robinson and too many more to list here. Visit <a href=\"https://rstats.ai/nyr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstats.ai/nyr/<\/a> for more information and use code nyhackr for a 20% discount.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>When would you use an R notebook versus a project dependency graph solver? Should everything be an R package? What can your R project workflow optimise for, and which properties of your work can this affect?<\/p> <p>Despite the importance of questions like these to having a happy and productive time with R, there is little community consensus on the principles for establishing R project workflows.<\/p> <p>We will begin the session by examining these questions and mapping out workflow styles served by existing R tooling. In the second half I will demonstrate practical productivity boosters my team and I have implemented along the way to a workflow centered on {drake}.<\/p> <p>About Miles:<br/>I'm a Data Scientist at Queensland Fire and Emergency Services where I use R to identify and analyse investment options in our emergency services network. Since I started programming in R about 5 years ago I've become an active #rstats tweeter, blogger, and RWeekly editor. I was an organiser of a local meetup group, three rOpensci OzUnconferences, and useR! 2018 Brisbane. I release R packages that do extremely niche things. Everyone's favourite is {datapasta} but {fnmate} is probably the one I get the most personal joy out of. I am into workflows because of their capacity to change the way work feels.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

Ahora tenemos una oportunidad que es importante que aprovochemos. Pero ¿cómo preparar una propuesta? ¿Qué debiese incluir el abstract? ¿Para qué conferencia es más apropiada la idea que tengo? ¿Qué debería tener en cuenta al pensar una propuesta de presentación para un meetup? ¿Es lo mismo escribir un abstract para una conferencia de R que para una conferencia en mi disciplina? ¿Qué tengo que incluir en la Bio?

Unlike many datasets that provide only aggregate case counts, the working group dataset collects individual-level case data, which are particularly valuable during outbreaks but are seldom made available in real time. This dataset feeds into an interactive dashboard, which enables users to visualize the data and identify key health outcome trends.<\/p> <p>The dataset and dashboard have become a reliable pan-Canadian source for COVID-19 information. Additionally, this has the potential for future linkages with diverse datasets, such as policy interventions, socio-behavioural changes, environmental factors, and other population-level factors. The open access aspect of this work encourages transparency and data sharing, which are crucial for supporting evidence-based control strategies and directing public health response efforts in Canada for the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>This talk will provide an overview of the key features associated with the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets and feature a demonstration of the tools available on the R Shiny dashboard. We will also discuss some of the key epidemiological insights that have been<br/>observed from this data and dashboard to date.<\/p> <p>About Isha Berry:<br/>Isha Berry is a PhD Candidate in Epidemiology at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health and a Fellow in the Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity Initiative at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security. She is a co-founder of the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group, which leads digital surveillance of COVID-19 cases in Canada to curate a publicly available line list and public-facing data dashboard. Isha has expertise in infectious disease epidemiology, geo-spatial methods, and mathematical modelling. Her primary area of research is understanding the socio-behavioral drivers of global emerging infectious diseases.

    "start": "2020-08-04",
    "description": "<p>The techniques in this tutorial enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of complicated projects with long runtimes. The drake R package resolves the dependency structure of data analysis pipelines, skips tasks that are already up to date, and cleanly organizes the output. Workflows with drake are efficient to maintain, and they provide tangible evidence that the results are synchronized with the underlying code and data, which increases one’s ability to trust the conclusions of the research.<\/p> <p>Learning objectives:<br/>1. Function-oriented programming: participants will learn to express data analysis tasks as user-defined<br/>functions, experience the advantages of functions relative to imperative scripts, and understand the role<br/>of functions in drake-powered projects.<br/>2. Declarative workflows: students will declare targets to represent data analysis artifacts, identify the<br/>dependencies of those targets, and inspect the emergent dependency structures of entire workflows.<br/>3. Project maintenance: students will experience drake’s responses to changing code and data, and they<br/>will understand the conditions that allow drake to skip computation and save time.<br/>4. Large plans: participants will practice declaring large collections of targets compactly using drake’s<br/>domain-specific language.<\/p> <p>Computing requirements:<br/>Each participant must have a laptop with a web browser and the ability to connect to the internet. Students will spend most of their time<br/>working through R notebooks and supporting Shiny applications.<br/>• notebooks: <a href=\"https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/tree/master/inst/notebooks\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/tree/master/inst/notebooks<\/a><br/>• learndrakeflow app: <a href=\"https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeflow\" class=\"linkified\">https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeflow<\/a><br/>• learndrakeplans app: <a href=\"https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeplans\" class=\"linkified\">https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeplans<\/a><br/>• drakeplanner app: <a href=\"https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/drakeplanner\" class=\"linkified\">https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/drakeplanner<\/a><br/>Online RStudio Server instances will be provided so participants can interact with the notebooks without<br/>needing to install anything locally.<\/p> <p>The instructor:<br/>Will Landau received his PhD in Statistics at Iowa State University in 2016. His dissertation research<br/>introduced a novel fully Bayesian, hierarchical model-driven, GPU-accelerated approach to the analysis of heterosis gene expression data (Landau, Niemi, and Nettleton 2019). He currently works at Eli Lilly and<br/>Company, where he develops capabilities for clinical statisticians.<br/>Will is the creator and maintainer of rOpenSci’s drake R package.

Ahora tenemos una oportunidad que es importante que aprovochemos. Pero ¿cómo preparar una propuesta? ¿Qué debiese incluir el abstract? ¿Para qué conferencia es más apropiada la idea que tengo? ¿Qué debería tener en cuenta al pensar una propuesta de presentación para un meetup? ¿Es lo mismo escribir un abstract para una conferencia de R que para una conferencia en mi disciplina? ¿Qué tengo que incluir en la Bio? Para responder estas preguntas y compartir algunas recomendaciones para diseñar tu propuesta nos juntaremos el próximo sábado 1 de agosto :)<\/p> <p>- ¿Y si todavía no tengo una idea para una presentación?<\/p> <p>No importa. Durante la sesión hablaremos también sobre cómo generar ideas. Además, para el caso de algunas conferencias hay tiempo todavía. Quizás ahora mismo no se te ocurre nada en particular, pero puedes empezar a planear un proyecto para presentar en alguno de los eventos del próximo año.<\/p> <p>- ¿Qué necesito para participar?<\/p> <p>Lo primero, es leer nuestro código de conducta. Es requisito para asistir estar de acuerdo con él: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish<\/a>. Queremos que nuestros meetups sean un espacio seguro y amable en que todas las personas se sientan cómodas participando.<\/p> <p>Lo segundo, es asegurarte de que puedes utilizar la aplicación Zoom en tu computador. El día del taller te enviaremos el enlace para unirte (chequea ese día que el mensaje no se haya ido a la carpeta de spam). Usualmente compartimos el enlace 30 minutos antes de la sesión.<\/p> <p>- ¿Hay algo más que deba saber sobre este evento?<\/p> <p>Esta es una actividad organizada por los capítulos de RLadies de Chile en conjunto con LatinR (<a href=\"https://latin-r.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://latin-r.com/<\/a>), la Conferencia Latinoamericana sobre Uso de R en Investigación + Desarrollo. Queremos más representación de Latinoamérica en las conferencias de R alrededor del mundo y qué mejor que apoyarnos como comunidad para lograrlo.<\/p> <p>El taller estará a cargo de Riva Quiroga (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga<\/a>).<\/p> ",

Presentaremos dashboards elaborados con RStudio donde se pueden visualizar todas las estadísticas correspondientes a cada uno de los países, y mostraremos los resultados y las variaciones en los índices de violencia.<\/p> <p>Contaremos con la presencia de profesionales, quienes nos ayudarán a analizar la situación por medio de preguntas y comentarios del público asistente para que desde la óptica profesional tengamos un acercamiento de lo que pueden ser las causas o condiciones que ocasionan el posible incremento de la violencia en medio de la pandemia.<\/p> <p>El meetup se realizará por la plataforma virtual ZOOM; el enlace se compartirá minutos antes del evento.<\/p> ",

El ecosistema mlr3 provee una solución completa para todas tus necesidades de ML, incluyendo pre-procesamiento de datos, diseño y evaluación de modelos de aprendizaje automático, conjuntos de modelos (ensembles), visualizaciones, y ajuste de hiperparámetros (a través de mlr3tuning). El proceso (pipeline) mlr3pipelines permite expresar flujos de trabajo complejos de manera sencilla, y probar nuevas ideas y aplicaciones. mlr3 puede ayudar a hacer tu flujo de trabajo más fácil de leer y más eficiente sin importar el tipo de problema o aplicación que quieras resolver con ML.<\/p> <p>Este tutorial está dirigido a usuarios con un conocimiento de conceptos básicos de aprendizaje automático (machine learning), pero no necesariamente debes tener conocimiento previo del paquete mlr3. Los participantes también deberán tener al menos un conocimiento intermedio de R y conocer los tipos de datos generales utilizados por R, así como habilidad para llevar a cabo operaciones básicas. Es preferible que tengan experiencia con R6 y data.table, pero no es esencial.<\/p> <p>Puedes acceder al material del curso a través del repositorio de GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/mlr-org/user2020\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/mlr-org/user2020<\/a> . Puedes descargar los material con antelación para que puedas seguir el curso en vivo, o para practicar los ejercicios en cualquier otro momento. El tutorial será en inglés, pero tendremos subtítulos disponibles en español para que nos puedas seguir con facilidad.<\/p> <p>Recuerda que al participar en nuestros eventos deberás aceptar el código de conducta de R-Ladies ( <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a> ), así como el de useR! 2020 ( <a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/<\/a> ).<\/p> <p>Nuestros eventos están abiertos a todos los miembros de la comunidad de R, pero incentivamos particularmente a mujeres y miembros de grupos minoritarios a registrarse con nosotras.<\/p> <p>**English**<br/>R-Ladies Ecuador is bringing you the online tutorial: 'Machine learning con mlr3' taught by Bernd Bischl and Michel Lang, which is part of useR! 2020.<\/p> <p>In this three hour tutorial you will be introduced to the mlr3 R package for modern, state-of-the-art machine learning (ML). The mlr3 ecosystem provides a one-stop solution for all ML needs, spanning preprocessing, model learning and evaluation, ensembles, visualization, and hyperparameter tuning (via mlr3tuning). Its pipeline system mlr3pipelines allows to easily express complex workflows, and to quickly prototype new ideas and applications. Whether you are applying ML to solve a practical prediction problem, implementing learning algorithms as a research software engineer or researching ML by empirical means, mlr3 can help make your workflow more readable and efficient.<\/p> <p>We target to users with at least basic knowledge of ML concepts who are not yet familiar with mlr3. We require a working knowledge of R at medium level. One should know R's general type system and basic operations. Some experience with R6 and data.table definitely help, but is not essential.<\/p> <p>You can access all course material through GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/mlr-org/user2020\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/mlr-org/user2020<\/a> .

On August 12th, 2020, we have a very exciting R Ladies presentation by Irene Steves and Yogev Herz, tuning in from Tel Aviv! (Yes, R-Ladies Amsterdam is globalizing =) !)<\/p> <p>[TOPIC]<br/>-----------<br/>Irene and Yogev work in Tel Aviv for the eCommerce fraud protection company Riskified.<\/p> <p>In their work, they often come across fraud patterns in eCommerce that their regular models cannot detect. While retraining models on newer data can solve some of these problems, some patterns require entirely new analyses.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Irene and Yogev will discuss how they tackled fraudsters taking advantage of \"Buy Online Pay in Store\" policies, and how R packages helped gradually transition from analyses to production-ready code.<\/p> <p>[ABOUT IRENE and YOGEV]<br/>-------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Irene holds an M.Sc. in Ecology and a B.A. in Integrative Biology, through which she first discovered R and data science. Her interest in data-led her to the Arctic Data Center at the University of California Santa Barbara, a summer internship at RStudio, and ultimately to the Research department at Riskified, where she now explores the fascinating patterns of fraud in e-commerce.<\/p> <p>Yogev first encountered R when studying the social organization of bumblebees for his M.Sc. in evolutionary biology. He transitioned to full-time R user and programmer when he left the hot and humid beehive to the air-conditioned office space of the research department in Riskified. He enjoys learning new R tricks and packages to improve the department’s data science capabilities.<\/p> <p>[PROGRAMME]<br/>---------------------<br/>To come<\/p> <p>[ZOOM LINK]<br/>-------------------<br/>To come<\/p> ",

Luckily R has your back and teaching yourself new skills is something you can achieve from the comfort of your couch.

At its core, racism is a powerful system that creates false hierarchies of human value; its warped logic extends beyond race, from the way we regard people of different ethnicities or skin colors to the way we treat people of different sexes, gender identities, and body types. Racism intersects with class and culture and geography and even changes the way we see and value ourselves. In How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi takes readers through a widening circle of antiracist ideas--from the most basic concepts to visionary possibilities--that will help readers see all forms of racism clearly, understand their poisonous consequences, and work to oppose them in our systems and in ourselves. Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science with his own personal story of awakening to antiracism. This is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond the awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a just and equitable society. Praise for How to Be an Antiracist \"Ibram X. Kendi's new book, How to Be an Antiracist, couldn't come at a better time. . . . Kendi has gifted us with a book that is not only an essential instruction manual but also a memoir of the author's own path from anti-black racism to anti-white racism and, finally, to antiracism. . . . How to Be an Antiracist gives us a clear and compelling way to approach, as Kendi puts it in his introduction, 'the basic struggle we're all in, the struggle to be fully human and to see that others are fully human.' \"--NPR \"Kendi dissects why in a society where so few people consider themselves to be racist the divisions and inequalities of racism remain so prevalent. How to Be an Antiracist punctures the myths of a post-racial America, examining what racism really is--and what we should do about it.\"--Time<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

Ahora tenemos una oportunidad que es importante que aprovochemos. Pero ¿cómo preparar una propuesta? ¿Qué debiese incluir el abstract? ¿Para qué conferencia es más apropiada la idea que tengo? ¿Qué debería tener en cuenta al pensar una propuesta de presentación para un meetup? ¿Es lo mismo escribir un abstract para una conferencia de R que para una conferencia en mi disciplina? ¿Qué tengo que incluir en la Bio? Para responder estas preguntas y compartir algunas recomendaciones para diseñar tu propuesta nos juntaremos el próximo sábado 1 de agosto :)<\/p> <p>- ¿Y si todavía no tengo una idea para una presentación?<\/p> <p>No importa. Durante la sesión hablaremos también sobre cómo generar ideas. Además, para el caso de algunas conferencias hay tiempo todavía.

Es requisito para asistir estar de acuerdo con él: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish<\/a>. Queremos que nuestros meetups sean un espacio seguro y amable en que todas las personas se sientan cómodas participando.<\/p> <p>Lo segundo, es asegurarte de que puedes utilizar la aplicación Zoom en tu computador. El día del taller te enviaremos el enlace para unirte (chequea ese día que el mensaje no se haya ido a la carpeta de spam). Usualmente compartimos el enlace 30 minutos antes de la sesión.<\/p> <p>- ¿Hay algo más que deba saber sobre este evento?<\/p> <p>Esta es una actividad organizada por los capítulos de RLadies de Chile en conjunto con LatinR (<a href=\"https://latin-r.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://latin-r.com/<\/a>), la Conferencia Latinoamericana sobre Uso de R en Investigación + Desarrollo. Queremos más representación de Latinoamérica en las conferencias de R alrededor del mundo y qué mejor que apoyarnos como comunidad para lograrlo.<\/p> <p>El taller estará a cargo de Riva Quiroga (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga<\/a>).<\/p> ",
