Спасибо им за это.<\/p> <p>Поговорим про использовании R в лингвистике, Fuzzy Matching и машинном обучении в R. Все доклады будут на английском.<\/p> <p>Анонсы докладов:<\/p> <p>Speaker 1:<br/>Anton Antonov, dxFeed Solutions GmbH,<br/>R in linguistic studies<br/>I have always known that linguistics and mathematics have a lot in common. Still, I was surprised to discover the true extent of that similarity. The complexity, the aesthetics, seemingly impossible problems that are resolved by establishing intrinsic relations between abstract objects... Finally, the helpfulness of R in dealing with these challenges.<br/>In this obviously non-serious talk, I will be speaking about my amateurish attempts at passing a particularly complex online course in linguistics using only my head, a pen, a sheet of paper, and R.<\/p> <p>Speaker 2:<br/>Alexey Osipov, Sidenis,<br/>Linking via Fuzzy Matching<br/>Quite often we have to link datasets by text fields, in which the same information is represented in different ways.<br/>We will consider several test cases for the problem of linking various datasets:<\/p> <p>linking of datasets by text fields with meaningful information,<br/>linking of datasets with short text fields with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names),<br/>linking of a dataset with unstructured text with a dataset with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names).<br/>We will discuss the theory, look into the relevant R packages, and outline the applications in insurance.<br/>Speaker 3:<br/>Martin Binder, creator of the mlr3piplines package,<br/>mlr3: Machine Learning, Pipelines, and AutoML in R<br/>One of R's strong points for data science is the availability of many different machine learning algorithms and implementations. This diversity, however, comes at the cost of inconsistent APIs, which often require writing custom glue code for everyday tasks such as resampling or data preprocessing. 'mlr3' and accompanying packages remedy this by offering a uniform interface to many machine learning methods, while at the same time providing a broad range of further functionality.<br/>We will present the possibilities offered by 'mlr3': From basics like model fitting and inference, over model performance evaluation, benchmarking, and hyperparameter tuning, to the capability to build complex data pre- and post-processing pipelines with simple building blocks and a natural data flow paradigm. Finally, we will provide links to further resources on how mlr3 can be used most effectively.<\/p> ",

Furthermore, Sentinel-2 sensors, including 13 spectral bands in the visible and infrared wavelengths, provide very valuable information which can be used to automatically perform tasks such as classify crop types, assess forest changes, or monitor build-up area development. This is particularly important now, in the era of rapid changes in the environment related to climate change. In R, there are plenty of tools and packages which can be used for satellite images such as pre-processing, analyzing, and visualizing data in a simple and efficient way. Also, the variety of methods, such as machine learning algorithms, are available in R and can be applied in the analysis of satellite imagery. I would like to show the framework for acquiring, pre-processing and preliminary analysis of the Sentinel-2 time series in R. It includes the spectral indices calculation, the use of the machine learning algorithms in the classification of land cover, and, the analysis of time series of imagery, i.e. determining the changes in environment based on the spectral trajectories of pixels.<\/p> <p>Biography:<br/>Ewa is a Ph.D. candidate in geography at the Jagiellonian University, and a research assistant at the Faculty of Forestry, the University of Agriculture in Kraków. In her research, she focus on the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in determining different forest characteristics, such as tree species composition or detection of forest disturbances. She is also a big R enthusiast and she mostly use it in my analysis!<\/p> ",

He is the creator and contributor to a number of R packages (**reporteR**, **MESS**, **MethComp**, **SuperRanker**) and is the author of \"The R Primer\" book. He has previously given R tutorials at useR 2016, eRum 2018, and ASAs Conference on Statistical Practice 2018, and won the C. Oswald George prize from Teaching Statistics in 2014.<\/p> <p>### Anne Helby Petersen<br/>is a PhD student in biostatistics at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. She is the primary author of several R packages, including **reporteR**. She has taught statistics and R in numerous courses at the University of Copenhagen with students coming from a wide range of backgrounds, including science, medicine and mathematics.<\/p> <p># Talk description<\/p> <p>## Clean up your data screening process with **reporteR**<br/>Data cleaning and data validation are the first steps in practically any data analysis, as the validity of the conclusions from the analysis hinges on the quality of the input data.<\/p> <p>Mistakes in the data can arise for any number of reasons, including erroneous codings, malfunctioning measurement equipment, and inconsistent data generation manuals. Consequently, it is essential to enable topic experts who are knowledgeable about the context and data collection procedure to partake in the data quality assessment since they will be better at identifying potential problems in the data. However, they may not have the technical skills to work with the data themselves.<\/p> <p>The reporteR package (formerly known as dataMaid) makes it easy to produce a document that less R-savvy collaborators can read, understand and use to decide “do these data look right?” and documents which potential errors were considered. Both will help ensure subsequent reproducible data science and document the data at all stages of the quality assessment process.<\/p> <p>The package includes both very user-friendly one-liner commands that auto-generates data overview reports, as well as a highly customizable suite of data validation and documentation tools that can be moulded to fit most data validation needs. And, perhaps most importantly, it was specifically build to make sure that documentation and validation go hand in hand, so we can clean up any unstructured messy data cleaning process.<\/p> <p># Sponsor<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an advanced analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.

Talk: 16:00 Anton Antonov, dxFeed Solutions GmbH, R in linguistic studies<\/p> <p>I have always known that linguistics and mathematics have a lot in common. Still I was surprised to discover the true extent of that similarity. The complexity, the aesthetics, seemingly impossible problems that are resolved by establishing intrinsic relations between abstract objects... Finally, the helpfulness of R in dealing with these challenges.<\/p> <p>In this obviously non-serious talk I will be speaking about my amateurish attempts at passing a particularly complex online course in linguistics using only my head, a pen, a sheet of paper and R.<\/p> <p>### 2. Talk: 16:30 Alexey Osipov, Sidenis, Linking via Fuzzy Matching.<\/p> <p>Quite often we have to link datasets by text fields, in which the same information is represented in different ways.<\/p> <p>We will consider several test cases for the problem of linking of various datasets:<\/p> <p>1) linking of datasets by text fields with meaningful information,<\/p> <p>2) linking of datasets with short text fields with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names),<\/p> <p>3) linking of a dataset with unstructured text with a dataset with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names).<\/p> <p>We will discuss the theory, look into the relevant R packages, and outline the applications in insurance.<\/p> <p>### 3. Talk: 17:00 Martin Binder, developer of mlr3pipelines, mlr3: Machine Learning, Pipelines and AutoML in R<\/p> <p>One of R's strong points for data science is the availability of many different machine learning algorithms and implementations. This diversity, however, comes at the cost of inconsistent APIs, which often require writing custom glue code for everyday tasks such as resampling or data preprocessing. 'mlr3' and accompanying packages remedy this by offering a uniform interface to many machine learning methods, while at the same time providing a broad range of further functionality.<\/p> <p>We will present the possibilities offered by 'mlr3': From basics like model fitting and inference, over model performance evaluation, benchmarking and hyperparameter tuning, to the capability to build complex data pre- and post-processing pipelines with simple building blocks and a natural data flow paradigm. Finally, we will provide links to further resources on how mlr3 can be used most effectively.<\/p> ",

Please see event details below:<\/p> <p>Topics:<br/>- R in linguistic studies<br/>- Linking via Fuzzy Matching<br/>- Machine Learning, Pipelines and AutoML in R<\/p> <p>## Applied R Munich Christmas Edition<\/p> <p>This year's Applied R Munich Christmas Edition will be held online as a joint Meetup with our friends from the St. Petersburg R User Group.<\/p> <p>Thanks to JetBrains for the support in organizing the virtual event.<\/p> <p>Please, don't hesitate to contact us at [masked] (or via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/applied_r\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/applied_r<\/a>) if your company would be willing to host one of our next meetups or if you have an interesting talk about an R related topic that you would like to present in a Meetup.<\/p> <p>## Agenda for the Meetup<\/p> <p>### 1. Talk: 16:00 Anton Antonov, dxFeed Solutions GmbH, R in linguistic studies<\/p> <p>I have always known that linguistics and mathematics have a lot in common. Still I was surprised to discover the true extent of that similarity. The complexity, the aesthetics, seemingly impossible problems that are resolved by establishing intrinsic relations between abstract objects... Finally, the helpfulness of R in dealing with these challenges.<\/p> <p>In this obviously non-serious talk I will be speaking about my amateurish attempts at passing a particularly complex online course in linguistics using only my head, a pen, a sheet of paper and R.<\/p> <p>### 2. Talk: 16:30 Alexey Osipov, Sidenis, Linking via Fuzzy Matching.<\/p> <p>Quite often we have to link datasets by text fields, in which the same information is represented in different ways.<\/p> <p>We will consider several test cases for the problem of linking of various datasets:<\/p> <p>1) linking of datasets by text fields with meaningful information,<\/p> <p>2) linking of datasets with short text fields with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names),<\/p> <p>3) linking of a dataset with unstructured text with a dataset with non-meaningful information (e.g., company names).<\/p> <p>We will discuss the theory, look into the relevant R packages, and outline the applications in insurance.<\/p> <p>### 3. Talk: 17:00 Martin Binder, developer of mlr3pipelines, mlr3: Machine Learning, Pipelines and AutoML in R<\/p> <p>One of R's strong points for data science is the availability of many different machine learning algorithms and implementations. This diversity, however, comes at the cost of inconsistent APIs, which often require writing custom glue code for everyday tasks such as resampling or data preprocessing. 'mlr3' and accompanying packages remedy this by offering a uniform interface to many machine learning methods, while at the same time providing a broad range of further functionality.<\/p> <p>We will present the possibilities offered by 'mlr3': From basics like model fitting and inference, over model performance evaluation, benchmarking and hyperparameter tuning, to the capability to build complex data pre- and post-processing pipelines with simple building blocks and a natural data flow paradigm. Finally, we will provide links to further resources on how mlr3 can be used most effectively.<\/p> ",

La raccolta di informazioni è necessaria per aiutare un sito web a crescere, targetizzare i clienti o analizzare fenomeni sociali. Riconoscendo questo problema, tante entità come Google e Apple, stanno promuovendo migliori tecniche di tutela e protezione della privacy. È qui che entra in gioco l'anonimizzazione dei dati.<\/p> <p>📣 Cos'è l'anonimizzazione dei dati e perché è importante?<\/p> <p>L'anonimizzazione dei dati rende non identificabili le informazioni identificabili. Ciò avviene tramite tecniche di elaborazione dati che rimuovono o codificano i dati personali. Quindi i dati diventano anonimi e non possono essere collegati a nessun individuo. L'anonimizzazione dei dati consente di rispettare i GDPR di tutto il mondo.<\/p> <p>In questo meetup esploreremo i metodi e le tecniche di base per la codifica dei dati che statistici e data scientist utilizzano per rendere anonimi i dati con R.<\/p> <p>Utilizzeremo il dataset prodotto dalle vostre risposte al seguente sondaggio ⬅️ compila il sondaggio e non mancare! 🙋‍♀️<\/p> <p>COMPILA IL SONDAGGIO: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/TTwTECZqfW9Af5nz8\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/TTwTECZqfW9Af5nz8<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Following up our earlier meetup about drake, we have its creator talking about its successor, targets.<\/p> <p>Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>This meetup is the kickoff to the second 2020 R week with The R Conference for Government &amp; Public Sector on December 2-4. Much like our recent NYR, this is virtual, so anyone around the world can attend. Visit <a href=\"https://rstats.ai/gov/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstats.ai/gov/<\/a> to learn more and use code nyhackr for a 20% discount on tickets, including workshops.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Ambitious workflows in R, such as machine learning analyses, can be difficult to manage. A single round of computation can take several hours to complete, and routine updates to the code and data tend to invalidate hard-earned results. You can enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of such projects with the targets R package. targets resolves the dependency structure of your analysis pipeline, skips tasks that are already up to date, executes the rest with optional distributed computing, and manages data storage for you. It surpasses the permanent limitations of its predecessor, drake, and provides increased efficiency and a smoother user experience. This talk demonstrates how to create and maintain a Bayesian model validation project using targets-powered automation.<\/p> <p>About Will:<br/>Will is a statistician and software developer. He likes to solve scientific problems and engage with data analysis technologies.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EST and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

We will hear from Gabriela de Queiroz, founder of R-Ladies and AI Inclusive. Gabriela will tell us about her career journey, as well as the many different roles a Data Scientist may have.<\/p> <p>At the end of the meeting, there will be time to ask any questions you may have about data scientist careers or questions about R in general.<\/p> <p>Don't forget to RSVP in our Meetup to get access to the meeting's ID and password.<\/p> <p>Big thanks to UCR Library and UCR GradQuant for supporting us.<\/p> <p>See you soon!<\/p> <p>## Details<\/p> <p>~ Data Science as a Team Sport ~<\/p> <p>Data Science careers are in high demand, with many job opportunities and attractive salaries. As a relatively new career, it is ambiguously defined, and the job description of a data scientist can vary greatly from company to company. For those reasons, Data Science has attracted both new grads and career changers from all sorts of different fields. For Statisticians, Data Science is an exciting opportunity to apply your hard-earned skills to a variety of interesting and challenging problems. Having a solid Statistics background will give you a head start in that direction. However, Data Science is much more than pure Statistics knowledge. Being able to recognize and take advantage of a team with a diverse set of experiences will provide you with a unique opportunity to grow individually while benefiting your entire team. In this talk, I will walk you through my career journey, the different roles a Data Scientist can take, useful skills for a successful career, and lessons learned.<\/p> <p>~ Bio ~<br/>Gabriela de Queiroz is a Sr. Engineering &amp; Data Science Manager at IBM where she manages and leads a team of developers working on Data &amp; AI Open Source projects.<br/>She works to democratize AI by building tools and launching new open source projects. She is passionate about making data science available to everybody and is actively involved with several organizations to foster an inclusive community.<br/>She is the founder of AI Inclusive (ai-inclusive.org), a global organization that is helping increase the representation and participation of gender minorities in Artificial Intelligence. She is also the founder of R-Ladies (rladies.org), a worldwide organization for promoting diversity in the R community with more than 180 chapters in 50+ countries.<br/>She has worked in several startups and where she built teams, developed statistical models, and employed a variety of techniques to derive insights and drive data-centric decisions.<br/>She likes to mentor and shares her knowledge through mentorship programs, tutorials, and talks.<\/p> ",

Implemented in an easily installed package with a detailed vignette, treeheatr can be a useful teaching tool to enhance students’ understanding of a simple decision tree model before diving into more complex tree-based machine learning methods.<\/p> <p>Trang is a postdoctoral fellow with Jason Moore at the Computational Genetics Lab, University of Pennsylvania. She enjoys developing machine learning methods for analyses of biomedical data, including neuroimage (functional/structural MRI), transcriptomics and genotypes. Most of the datasets she works with are high dimensional (i.e., have many predictors/features), so she spends most of her time building feature selection algorithms for these data. She trades her bias toward the nearest-neighbor concept for lower variance of her methods and better generalizability.

She has collaborated with medical and surgical oncologists in the design and analysis of large-scale Phase III cancer clinical trials, using survival and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. She has also worked closely with radiation biologists in developing and implementing innovative dose response designs for Phase I and II studies to evaluate dose escalation of radiation therapy, with immunologists developing designs for Phase II studies to evaluate combination therapy with biologic agents, and has used robust regression and data visualization tools in S-Plus and R to visualize dose response surfaces for combination antifungal drug therapy in murine models and in vitro drug susceptibility testing. Now retired, Dr. Madeline Bauer helps high school students with their science projects, mentors undergraduate statistics and data science students preparing for ASA DataFest, and serves as a co-organizer for R-Ladies Irvine.<\/p> <p>Abstract: The general purpose of developing a regression model is to understand the association between a response Y and X and/or to predict Y given X, where X is a set of independent variables. In this talk, we give an overview of regression and highlight some of the regression packages available in R. We start with examples of suggested best workflow practices that are useful regardless of the specific regression model. For model-specific workflows, we take advantage of the \"methods\" associated with the model, such as \"summary\", \"print\", and especially \"plot.\" These methods illustrate the individual package author’s approaches to check the model assumptions, estimate the association between the response and the covariates and evaluate the fit and accuracy of the resulting model. We will demonstrate these methods with real datasets. The data and R code will be available to download.<\/p> <p># A Study of Medical Treatments for COVID-19<br/>Speaker: Song Zhai<\/p> <p>Bio: Song Zhai is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at UC, Riverside. After finishing his master degree in the Department of Mathematics at Texas A&amp;M University, Song Zhai joined UCR in Fall 2016, under the supervision of Dr. Xinping Cui. Song’s previous projects include a retrospective study for biomarker selection with Parkside Medical Group; efficient polygenic risk score developing at Merck; and best predictive biomarker identification with Xinping. Song’s research focus is on pharmacogenomics, with an emphasis on applications rooted in biomarker study, multiple testing, and causal inference.<\/p> <p>Abstract: To the end of this study, various medical treatments for COVID-19 are attempted. A total of 417 patients were considered and 414 of them were included in this study (3 deaths) with mild-to-critical COVID-19. Patients were followed up for recurrence for 28 days quarantine after being discharged. We applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to overcome the rare recurring events in certain patient subgroups. Virtual Twins Matching (VTM) analysis, facilitated by random forest regression, was performed for medical treatment-recurrence classification, while minimizing effects of confounding factors. We used the Multiple Comparisons with the Best (MCB) as the test of the best drug combination in each patient subgroup. The insights into combinatorial therapy found in this study shed light on the use of a combination of (biological and chemical) anti-virus therapy and/or anti-cytokine storm as a potentially effective therapeutic treatment for COVID-19.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

Furthermore, Sentinel-2 sensors, including 13 spectral bands in the visible and infrared wavelengths, provide very valuable information which can be used to automatically perform tasks such as classify crop types, assess forest changes, or monitor build-up area development. This is particularly important now, in the era of rapid changes in the environment related to climate change. In R, there are plenty of tools and packages which can be used for satellite images such as pre-processing, analyzing, and visualizing data in a simple and efficient way. Also, the variety of methods, such as machine learning algorithms, are available in R and can be applied in the analysis of satellite imagery. I would like to show the framework for acquiring, pre-processing and preliminary analysis of the Sentinel-2 time series in R. It includes the spectral indices calculation, the use of the machine learning algorithms in the classification of land cover, and, the analysis of time series of imagery, i.e. determining the changes in environment based on the spectral trajectories of pixels.<\/p> <p>Biography:<br/>Ewa is a Ph.D. candidate in geography at the Jagiellonian University, and a research assistant at the Faculty of Forestry, the University of Agriculture in Kraków. In her research, she focus on the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in determining different forest characteristics, such as tree species composition or detection of forest disturbances. She is also a big R enthusiast and she mostly use it in my analysis!<\/p> ",

Connect provides a convenient place to share Shiny applications, R Markdown reports, dashboards, plots, models, APIs, Jupyter Notebooks, interactive Python content, and more. In this presentation, I will provide an overview of RStudio Connect and show how individuals are taking the work they have done on their own desktop and deploying that so anyone can interact with it, without having to know anything about R or Python themselves.<\/p> <p>### About Rachael<\/p> <p>Hi! I'm Rachael and I'm a Senior Enterprise Advocate at RStudio, helping data scientists from all over the world do more for their organization with RStudio's tools. I live in Boston and also organize the Boston useR Group, which are of course virtual now and open to anyone who is interested in attending. I love making people happy and learning from everyone I meet. In my role, I get to talk to awesome people every day and learn about what they're accomplishing with data. When I'm not working, I enjoy being active outside, doing yoga, running, playing guitar, trying new foods, and finding live music. I really like meeting new people and connecting others, so please say hello!<\/p> <p>## Talk #2<\/p> <p>Dirk Eddelbuettel - Using R via Rocker: A Brief Introduction with Examples<\/p> <p>### About the talk<br/>The Rocker Project (Docker Containers for the R Environment, <a href=\"https://www.rocker-project.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rocker-project.org/<\/a>), which is joint work with Carl Boettiger and Noam Ross, started in June of 2014 when Docker was still very new. The project has several hundred forks, over 1500 GitHub stars, and more than two million downloads on Docker Hub. This short talk will introduce the Rocker project, share a little of its history, and will demo use of a few applications of Rocker containers.<\/p> <p>### About Dirk<br/>Dirk Eddelbuettel (<a href=\"https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com<\/a>) left U Karlsruhe in the fall of 1990 for France aiming for two quick terms ... and has yet to return. Following graduate studies in France he settled in Canada only to then move to the USA in 2000. He has contributed to the Debian and R projects since the mid- and late 1990s, and maintains and/or (co)-authors a number of packages in each. After more than two decades in quantitative finance, he now works on R integration for TileDB, a universal data engine, and teaches a Data Science Programming class at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<\/p> <p>## Social Gathering<\/p> <p>After the talks we want you to virtually meet, chat, network, and discuss interesting topics.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>For the December edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Stephanie Kirmer as our guest speaker. She will introduce the topic of Isolation Forests for tree-based anomaly detection.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Branching Out into Isolation Forests: Tree Based Anomaly Detection<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Isolation forests offer a new way to approach unsupervised anomaly detection problems, and in this talk attendees will get an end-to-end tutorial with code and visual explanations on how to apply the technique in R. Among other advantages, isolation forests offer interpretability and rapid runtime, so they are useful in business and production settings.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Stephanie Kirmer is a Senior Data Scientist at Saturn Cloud, a platform enabling easy to use parallelization and scaling for Python with Dask. (But she still loves R as well.) Previously she worked as a DS Tech Lead at Journera, a travel data startup, and Senior Data Scientist at Uptake, where she developed predictive models for diagnosing and preventing mechanical failure. Before joining Uptake, she worked on data science for social policy research at the University of Chicago and taught sociology and health policy at DePaul University.<\/p> <p>Slides/Code:<br/>Stephanie's slides were prepared using the R xaringan package and are available in the following github repository in the 'r' subdirectory. Code used in her demo are also provided in the repo. You are invited to follow along during the presentation. <a href=\"https://github.com/skirmer/isolation_forests\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/skirmer/isolation_forests<\/a><\/p> <p>Twitter: @data_stephanie<\/p> <p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.stephaniekirmer.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.stephaniekirmer.com/<\/a><\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.

With huge amount of data becoming a norm nowadays, having both features are ideal to attack problems related to data science and machine learning. This talk will demonstrate how Julia and R features and packages can be used as complementary utilities to solve real problems. The approach adapts the unix pipeline workflow of solving problems by stitching together a set of small utilities from JuliaR that when combined in a certain way becomes an optimal solution to the problem. These small utilities if properly designed encourages reusability, seamless integration of Julia and R utils, and easy explainability of the entire workflow.<\/p> <p># Sponsor<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an advanced analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.

    "description": "<p>We have 3 confirmed lightning presentations for December's meetup!<br/>Additional details to be provided.<\/p> <p>Talk 1:<br/>Title: Advancing pre-clinical research with R and cloud computing<br/>Presented by Nobal Dhruw, Sabu George, Shashank Jatav<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>R has been the popular tool of choice for performing bioinformatics analysis by researchers in the drug discovery space given the availability of many open-source packages and libraries in the public domain. These open-source tools enable researchers to analyze and generate insights from their biomedical data. Typically, the analysis and the consumption of insights is done via an interactive web interface powered by shiny, an R package to build web-apps. However, our experience developing traditional shiny apps for biological (omics) data analysis, has exposed to us problems related to the handling of voluminous datasets, and the associated computationally expensive jobs, typical characteristics of biological data. Then, there is also the problem of workflow customisability, as a shiny app is often built to cater to one specific use case. But it is often desired to have a certain degree of flexibility and customisability in-built into the system, which would allow the end-users themselves to create their own workflow by stitching together the atomic components. Here, we describe how we have leveraged cloud computing services to mitigate these issues and create an infrastructure which would enable the bioinformaticians to perform data analysis in an easy and intuitive manner, and at the same time giving them the liberty to package their R code as a custom component, without having to worry about how to make their code production-ready. Our infrastructure platform manages the allocation of machine resources required to execute the component.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Nobal Dhruw (Sr. Data Scientist, Elucidata)<br/>Sabu George (Tech Lead, Elucidata)<br/>Shashank Jatav (Sr. Data Scientist, Elucidata)<\/p> <p>Talk #2:<br/>R and SQLite: A Winning Combination<br/>Presented by Bryan Cafferky<\/p> <p>R is an awesome data analysis language.

    "description": "<p>The {brms} package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using Stan, a C++ package for performing full Bayesian inference (see <a href=\"https://mc-stan.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://mc-stan.org/<\/a>). The formula syntax is very similar to that of the {lme4} package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p>[Bio]<br/>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany). He is the author of the R package {brms} and member of the Stan Development Team. Previously, he studied Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen (Germany) and did his PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. He has also worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University (Finland).<\/p> <p>[About]<br/>This event is organized by the Oslo useR!

    "description": "<p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.li/H0BvQkk0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.li/H0BvQkk0<\/a><\/p> <p>As providers of an end-to-end MLOps platform, we find that autoscaling ML inference is a frequent customer ask. Recently, serverless computing has been touted as the panacea for elastic compute that can provide flexibility and lower operating costs. However, for ML, the need to precisely define hardware configurations and long warm-up times of certain ML models exacerbate the limitations of serverless. To provide the best solution to our customers, we have run extensive benchmarking experiments comparing the performance of serverless and traditional computing for inference workloads running on Kubernetes (with KubeFlow and with the ModelDB MLOps Toolkit). Our experiments have spanned a variety of model types, data modalities, hardware, and workloads. In this talk, we present the results from our benchmarking study and provide a guide to architect your own k8s-based ML inference system.<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.li/H0BvQkk0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.li/H0BvQkk0<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>[Abstract]<br/>The {brms} package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using Stan, a C++ package for performing full Bayesian inference (see <a href=\"https://mc-stan.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://mc-stan.org/<\/a>). The formula syntax is very similar to that of the {lme4} package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p>[Bio]<br/>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany).

    "description": "<p>Steve Pittard has gracefully offered to help us get this group rebooted. He will be delivering a talk on predictive learning in R via Zoom. Please join us next week!<\/p> <p>Overview:<\/p> <p>Many researchers and analysts (and those who aspires to be) have an awareness of Machine Learning methods but lack a general framework for the implementation, interpretation, and deployment of predictive models. This session motivates use of the caret package which provides a streamlined interface to over 200 different methods used in Machine Learning. The caret package eases the comparison of various models in a reproducible way. The session will also include a demonstration of popular “Auto Machine Learning” services that heuristically select models appropriate for the data.<\/p> <p>Mr. Pittard develops Data Science coursework for Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. He is the recent recipient of a US Patent for OmicSeq, a genomic search engine which can be used to identify genes as indicators of cancer treatment protocols. He is a contributor to the upcoming Springer book entitled Computational Methods and Data Analysis for Metabolomics.<br/>When: Dec 17,[masked]:00 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada)<\/p> <p>Register in advance for this meeting:<br/><a href=\"https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUqduGopjIvHNJlmDq1-Ys2Q_I0zB1UBeqI\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJUqduGopjIvHNJlmDq1-Ys2Q_I0zB1UBeqI<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Come join us for the last BARUG meetup of 2020. Our speakers include long time BARUG members and frequent speakers John-Mark Agosta and Norm Matloff, and first time speaker Paromita Dubey, Stanford Statistics Department Stein Fellow.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>5:00 Networking<br/>5:30 Announcements<br/>5:40 John-Mark Agosta: The \"PCA Trick\": Separating normal and abnormal time series components<br/>6:00 Paromita Dubey: Modeling time varying random objects and dynamic networks<br/>6:30 Norm Matloff: The Notion of Double Descent<\/p> <p>############<br/>John-mark Agosta<br/>The \"PCA Trick\": Separating normal and abnormal time series components<\/p> <p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is best known for its feature generation ability, to find a subspace where most of the feature variance lives. Alternately, when applied to concurrent time-series, it is capable of segregating data into common periodic versus occasional anomalous components.<\/p> <p>We show how this applies to detection of anomalies in VM performance time series, increasing the probability of detection while decreasing spurious alerts two orders of magnitude better than current naïve thresholding methods. We demonstrate this on data of incidents of known VM degradation, using conventional hold-out validation to optimize true positive and false positive rates.<\/p> <p>############<br/>Paromita Dubey<br/>Modeling time varying random objects and dynamic networks<\/p> <p>Functional Data Analysis tools have been widely studied for samples of curves that take values in a Hilbert space. Samples of dynamic or time-varying networks and other random object data such as time-varying probability distributions are increasingly encountered in modern data analysis.<\/p> <p>However, common methods for time-varying data such as functional data analysis are infeasible when observations are time courses of networks or other complex non-Euclidean random objects that are elements of general metric spaces. In such spaces, only pairwise distances between the data objects are available and a strong limitation is that one cannot carry out arithmetic operations due to the lack of an algebraic structure.<\/p> <p>We combat this complexity by a generalized notion of mean trajectory taking values in the object space. For this, we adopt pointwise Fréchet means and then construct pointwise distance trajectories between the individual time courses and the estimated Fréchet mean trajectory, thus representing the time-varying objects and networks by functional data. Functional principal component analysis of these distance trajectories can reveal interesting features of dynamic networks and object time courses and is useful for downstream analysis.<\/p> <p>Our approach also makes it possible to study the empirical dynamics of time-varying objects, including dynamic regression to the mean or explosive behavior over time. We demonstrate desirable asymptotic properties of sample based estimators for suitable population targets under mild assumptions. The utility of the proposed methodology is illustrated with both dynamic network and time-varying distribution data.<\/p> <p>#####<br/>Norm Matloff<br/>The Notion of Double Descent<\/p> <p>The notion of double descent, which has come into prominence in the last few years, is something I regard as genuinely new and very relevant, shedding important light on the central issue of model overfitting.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I’ll explain the idea, and illustrate it using code from my regtools R package. (Have a look at Norm's Post (<a href=\"https://matloff.wordpress.com/2020/11/11/the-notion-of-double-descent/#comments\" class=\"linkified\">https://matloff.wordpress.com/2020/11/11/the-notion-of-double-descent/#comments<\/a>) to prepare for the talk.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hi, everybody!<br/>We hope that you and your family are doing well. We are super excited to have Erin, co-founder of R-Ladies global, founder of the Women in Machine Learning and Data Science and Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai to bring you a workshop on Automatic and Explainable Machine Learning in R with H2O!<\/p> <p>DESCRIPTION<br/>----------------------<\/p> <p>H2O is an open source, distributed machine learning platform is designed to scale to very large datasets. H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface which automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models from a single function, `h2o.automl()`. The result of the AutoML run is a \"leaderboard\" of H2O models, which can be then be explained automatically using the H2O Explainability interface.<\/p> <p>The models can be explained individually, and also compared as a group and both global (model-wise) and local (row-wise) explainations are available. The `h2o.explain()` function generates a list of explanations – individual units of explanation such as a Partial Dependence plot or a Variable Importance plot. Most of the explanations are visual – these plots can also be created by individual utility functions outside the `h2o.explain()` function. The visualization engine used in the R interface is the ggplot2 package and in Python, we use matplotlib.<\/p> <p>R code with a full demo will be provided, which can be used to automatically train and explain models on your own dataset.<\/p> <p>PROGRAMME<br/>----------------------<br/>[masked] Virtual Welcome<br/>19.05- 20.30 Talk &amp; Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>ABOUT ERIN<br/>----------------------<br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-ledell/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-ledell/<\/a><br/>Erin LeDell is the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, the company that produces the open source, distributed machine learning platform, H2O.

But, if you type in \"white girls,\" the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about \"why black women are so sassy\" or \"why black women are so angry\" presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society.<\/p> <p>In Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.<\/p> <p>Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance-operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond-understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance.<\/p> <p>An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>At this virtual meetup, R-Ladies RTP member Melissa Wong (she/her), will introduce some R packages (rstanarm, rethinking, and possibly brms) for Bayesian models that are a bit easier to get started with than rstan. Melissa will include examples of both a simple linear regression and a semi-parametric regression in all packages, and talk about what she found to be a beginner-friendly path to work up to using rstan directly.<\/p> <p>Melissa's Bio: I'm a Senior Engineer with The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. I started my career as a software and systems engineer. Since finishing my M.S. in Statistics I've become interested in learning more about Bayesian methods and causal inference.<\/p> <p>Special thanks to Melissa for suggesting, developing, and leading this meetup!<\/p> <p>What do I bring?<br/>Please login to Zoom using a laptop or computer with the capabilities to run R and RStudio. We encourage attendees to install or update their versions of R and RStudio as well as their R packages. To update your R Packages in RStudio go to Tools &gt; \"Check for package updates...\". Here are links to free downloads for R (<a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://cran.r-project.org/<\/a>) and RStudio (<a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download<\/a>). Downloading and installing both of these programs before this meetup will help us keep on schedule and make sure you learn the most you can while at the meetup event.<\/p> <p>Who is this event for?<br/>Beginners are welcome and encouraged to join this event but please install the most recent version of both R and RStudio on your laptop before attending this meetup event.

    "description": "<p>本次聚會地點於三創育成基金會（11F）場地<\/p> <p>講題：Recommendation Systems in Real Life<\/p> <p>講題介紹：<br/>Recommendation systems are used everywhere nowadays. This talk will discuss how differently recommendation systems are researched and applied in academia and industry, and challenges one might face or criteria one might care about when building recommendation systems. In real life, the job of a recommendation algorithm is not to be very predictive of past held-out interactions but is to be predictive of future interactions. What is really important is its performance after being deployed, which is in the future. In addition, users change over time, items change over time, even the system around the recommendation algorithm is going to change over time, which might impact things and need to be considered. In this talk, we will talk about how we tackle some of these challenges and recent trends in personalization at Netflix.<\/p> <p>講者介紹：<br/>Ko-Jen (Mark) Hsiao is a senior research scientist at Netflix, where he researches and implements innovative algorithms to optimize Netflix's core personalization. He has extensive experiences in applying machine learning at scale, building and A/B testing ranking and recommendation systems. Before he joined Netflix, he was a data scientist at Whisper, an anonymous social network app with over 30 million monthly active users. He developed and implemented several end-to-end machine learning systems used by the company. He obtained his PhD from the University of Michigan, where he focused on combining disparate information for machine learning applications.<\/p> ",
