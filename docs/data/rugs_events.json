With a view to address this, we have provisionally booked rooms to host these sessions, starting on a bi-monthly basis.<\/p> <p>To keep things interesting, the first 15 minutes of each session will be a demonstration of a R package. On Monday, we’ll demonstrate how to generate a reproducible example of a problem that can then be shared on an online users help forum. To do this we will be using the reprex and datapasta R packages. The floor will then be opened up for attendees to ask for help, share tips, identify resources and generally discuss ways of improving how we use R.<\/p> <p>So if you’re a new user interesting in getting tips on where to place that next step or you are more experienced and have a coding problem you need help solving, we look forward to meeting you on Monday.<\/p> ",

Firstly, I will give you an overview about statistical modelling in non-life insurance pricing and its specialties. How can modern machine learning challenge the good old GLM world? What is the role of ML interpretability and explainability in this challenge? I will illustrate the ideas on a large real world motor claims data set.<br/>In the second part I’d like to share some thoughts on model-agnostic measures of interaction strength. How can they be used to efficiently measure overall interaction strength per input variable? How can shortcomings in current partial dependence related measures be mended?<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Michael Mayer is an enthusiastic statistician and R programmer working as non-life pricing actuary for “Die Mobiliar”, one of the most traditional and successful insurance companies in Switzerland. Since finishing his PhD at the University of Bern in 2008, Michael has worked as biostatistician, predictive modeler, statistics consultant as well as University lecturer.

    "description": "<p>We're starting off the new year with a talk about both R and Stan.<\/p> <p>Thank you to New York Presbyterian for hosting.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Factorization machines are a powerful, flexible, and interpretable tool for modeling interactions between variables. However, there are a dearth of implementations of these models which allow for principled uncertainty estimates, especially in R. This talk will discuss implementing Bayesian Factorization Machines in R and Stan, first introducing basic models, and then, extending these models using techniques from modern hierarchical Bayesian modeling.<\/p> <p>About Adam:<br/>Adam Lauretig is the Senior Data Scientist at JUST Capital, where he works on Bayesian discrete-choice models, ranking methodology, and analyzing survey data. Previously, he completed his Ph.D. in political methodology at The Ohio State University, where he developed Bayesian Word Embeddings to study decision-making American Foreign Policy, and worked on a project with the World Bank, examining the effects of democratization on discrimination in the Indonesian Civil Service.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> ",

Cristina is a first year PhD student in the MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit looking at political polarization and radicalization online. She will introduce Shiny Apps: what they are; what they can be used for; and how to make a simple app. In addition, Cristina will show us a couple of apps she has built using different data sets as well as different Shiny app features. You can see the full code at: <a href=\"http://github.com/chuecadelc/\" class=\"linkified\">http://github.com/chuecadelc/<\/a> and follow her on Twitter @ChuecaCristina.<\/p> <p>Our second speaker is Jack Taylor who will present his work \"Automatic Item Matching for Science\". When designing scientific experiments, matching items by relevant variables between conditions is a good way to reduce noise and be more sure that an effect is truly due to whatever the experimenter varies. Examples include matching participants by variables like age and sex in randomised control trials, or matching image stimuli by variables like contrast and brightness. When the list of possible items is very large, matching items optimally can be very time-consuming. Thankfully, we have R!<\/p> <p>Come along to hear our two speakers. Afterwards we'll head to the Howlin' Wolf for post-meetup catchup!<\/p> <p>Please arrive between 1715 and 1730, there will be a rep at the main entrance where you sign in, and one on the top floor to let you in the Unit.

    "description": "<p>Happy New Year to everyone, and welcome to our first meeting of the year, at Coop Bank. Our host, Mart Kaska, has been using R to support anti-money laundering (AML) efforts at the bank. He will give us an overview of the role R plays in his work, and in his talk will discuss how he's worked to support conventional AML analysis with more quantitative insights. In the second talk I'm going to speak about how, and why, to write R applications with a RESTful web API using plumber and Docker.<\/p> <p>Program<br/>------------<\/p> <p>17:30 - Arrival and snacks<br/>18:00 - Introductory remarks by Mart Kaska, Coop Bank<br/>18:15 - Start of presentations (~20m each)<\/p> <p>First talk - Mart Kaska, Data Scientist at Coop Bank, \"How to catch bad guys with R?\"<\/p> <p>Conventional AML analysis relies on analysts' domain knowledge on what kinds of customer transactions are likely to indicate illegal behavior. Mart has been using R to prototype basic quantiative models of fraudulent activity, both in order to test whether it can help analysts prioritize high risk cases, and also to check whether model-based approaches can identify problematic cases conventional analysis misses. As is often the case when expert knowledge meets math, some challenges arise in bridging two very different approaches to AML.<\/p> <p>Second talk - Andreas Beger, Data Scientist at Predictive Heuristics, \"Writing R web APIs with plumber and Docker\"<\/p> <p>Two problems arise when moving from analysis that run on your own laptop to \"live\" functionality in a diverse team: how to allow non-R users to interface with R-based functionality, and second, how to make your code run on someone else's computer (or server). The plumber package provides a solution for the first problem by turning R code and functions into a web application with a RESTful API. Docker is a solution to the second problem by packaging all of this into a container that can be setup anywhere where Docker is installed, regardless of the underlying hardware.<\/p> <p>Third talk – Simon Wenkel, Machine Learning Engineer, “R – Python – Julia. Insights into old and new languages for data science and machine learning and implications for their use in (high performance) production environments”<\/p> <p>Using interpreted languages has many advantages for prototyping/exploratory work but certain disadvantages for production usage. To overcome some of these issues, we’ll<br/>- have a look at these languages and how there are implemented,<br/>- have a look under the hood of common data science/machine learning stacks in these 3 languages,<br/>- see how to speed them up without writing extensions in C/C++/Fortran,<br/>- have a look at things to consider when deploying them in production environments.<\/p> <p>Logistics<br/>-------------<\/p> <p>The meeting will take place at Coop Bank, Narva mnt 4. This is right next to the Hobujaama tram stops. In case you are driving, there are a small number of free parking spots next to the building. Once inside, tell the front desk person you came to the meetup, go past the turnstiles on the right and up to the 4th floor conference room.<\/p> <p>Snacks and refreshments will be available, and you can bring food if you'd like.<\/p> <p>Meeting GitHub repo<br/>---------------------------<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/r-tallinn/2020-01-coop-pank\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/r-tallinn/2020-01-coop-pank<\/a><\/p> ",

One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps.<\/p> <p>To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color.<\/p> <p>\"Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space.\"—Scientific American<\/p> <p>\"A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted. It shows how map makers translate abstract data into eye-catching cartograms, as they are called. It combats cartographic illiteracy. It fights cartophobia. It may even teach you to find your way. For that alone, it seems worthwhile.\"—Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times<\/p> <p>\". . . witty examination of how and why maps lie. [The book] conveys an important message about how statistics of any kind can be manipulated. But it also communicates much of the challenge, aesthetic appeal, and sheer fun of maps. Even those who hated geography in grammar school might well find a new enthusiasm for the subject after reading Monmonier's lively and surprising book.\"—Wilson Library Bulletin<\/p> <p>\"A reading of this book will leave you much better defended against cheap atlases, shoddy journalism, unscrupulous advertisers, predatory special-interest groups, and others who may use or abuse maps at your expense.\"—John Van Pelt, Christian Science Monitor<\/p> <p>\"Monmonier meets his goal admirably. . . . [His] book should be put on every map user's 'must read' list. It is informative and readable . . . a big step forward in helping us to understand how maps can mislead their readers.\"—Jeffrey S.

    "description": "<p>Talk 1:<br/>Speaker: Daniel Jacobs (@djacobs7), Senior Director, Data Science Engineering at Age Of Learning. Website: www.dontyouremember.com<\/p> <p>Title: Getting better at R By Learning More Packages More Deeply<\/p> <p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Learning R means learning dozens of different packages and methods. CRAN has over 10,000 packages, and it's not always clear what's important to learn next. Once you decide what to learn, it's can be difficult to commit the important methods to memory so that you can use them easily over the next weeks or months. This talk walks you through strategies for deciding what to learn, and then committing them to memory with the spaced repetition algorithm. It gives an example of discovering what packages to learn via code analysis. Finally, it describes the development of the remembR package, which lets you study R directly in R.<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Emil Hvitfeldt (@Emil_Hvitfeldt), Research Programmer at USC and Co-organizer of @laeRusers<\/p> <p>Title: Hyper-parameter Tuning with Tune Package<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Many statistical and machine learning models have parameters that can directly be inferred from the data.

Michael Espero is going to introduce the 'reticulate' package. Reticulate provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. The package includes facilities for:<\/p> <p>* Calling Python from R in a variety of ways including R Markdown, sourcing Python scripts, importing Python modules, and using Python interactively within an R session.<\/p> <p>* Translation between R and Python objects (for example, between R and Pandas data frames, or between R matrices and NumPy arrays).<\/p> <p>* Flexible binding to different versions of Python including virtual environments and Conda environments.<\/p> <p>Reticulate embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling seamless, high-performance interoperability. If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, reticulate can dramatically streamline your workflow!<\/p> <p>Come early, network and enjoy the food.

Osoby korzystające z niego nierzadko nie mają doświadczenia jako programiści. Kiedy kody które piszą stają się coraz bardziej skomplikowane, pojawia się problem zarządzania nimi, a także ich przejrzystości i stabilności. W ciągu 2-3 spotkań chcę opowiedzieć o narzędziach, pakietach i praktykach, które mogą pomóc w tym, aby tworzyć lepsze oprogramowanie. Na pierwszym spotkaniu chcę poruszyć kwestie ,,podstawowe”<\/p> <p>1. Tworzenie pakietów, dokumentacja w roxygen, ,,package check” w pakiecie devtools<br/>2. Automatyczne sprawdzenia i naprawa składni za pomocą pakietów usethis, lintr i styler<br/>3. Testowanie kodu za pomocą pakietów usethis i testthat<br/>4. Kontrola wersji (git, GitHub) (temat opcjonalny jeśli starczy nam czasu)<\/p> <p>Spotkanie będzie miało charakter warsztatowy dlatego jest bardzo ważne, żeby przynieść własne komputery.

W efekcie, rozbudziło to oczekiwania sektora biznesowego co do zakresu w jakim Sztuczna Inteligencja jest w stanie zastąpić pracowników w ich codziennej pracy. Podczas wykładu opowiem o projekcie cyfryzacji kontraktów który prowadzę od ponad roku. Celem projektu jest stworzenie narzędzia umożliwiającego automatyczne zarządzanie i analizę kontraktów zawieranych przez firmę. W tym celu przetestowaliśmy i wykorzystujemy najnowsze (jak i odrobinę starsze) techniki uczenia maszynowego, typu BERT, czy CatBoost, jak i zaadoptowaliśmy podejście Active Learning w uczeniu SI rozpoznawania nowych klauzul umownych. Wykład ma na celu omówienie głównych założeń projektu, zaprezentowanie naszego podejścia i przedstawienie użytych technik uczenia maszynowego.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Doktor nauk technicznych specjalizujący się w zaawansowanej analizie danych (Data Science). Absolwent Polsko-Japońskiej Akademii Technik Komputerowych (dr, informatyka) i Szkoły Głównej Handlowej (mgr, metody ilościowe w ekonomii i systemy informacyjne). Były konsultant McKinsey, obecnie Product Owner w firmie Nokia specjalizujący się w prowadzeniu projektów automatyzujących skomplikowane procesy biznesowe (w szczególności przy wykorzystaniu technik sztucznej inteligencji i przetwarzania języka naturalnego) i zarządzający dużymi zespołami eksperckimi.<\/p> <p>Temat #2<\/p> <p>Mówca: Mateusz Staniak<br/>Temat: Szybka i zautomatyzowana eksploracja danych w R (autoEDA).<\/p> <p>Abstrakt:<br/>Czyszczenie i eksploracja danych to kluczowe elementy procesu analitycznego, które wpływają zarówno na jakość budowanych modeli predykcyjnych/statystycznych, jak i zrozumienie problemu biznesowego i charakterystyki danych.<br/>W R, i w innych językach do analizy danych, powstaje coraz więcej narzędzi, które mają na celu jak najmocniej przyspieszyć i zautomatyzować eksplorację danych. Do najważniejszych przykładów należą pakiety DataExplorer i dataMaid.<br/>Opowiem o ogólnych metodach i pakietach R-owych, które pomagają ograniczyć ilość pisanego kodu i zautomatyzować typowe elementy eksploracji danych.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Jestem doktorantem ze statystyki w Instytucie Matematyki UWr, freelancer.

Allaire)<\/p> <p>** Open-source software is fundamentally necessary to ensure that the tools of data science are broadly accessible, and to provide a reliable and trustworthy foundation for reproducible research. This talk will delve into why open source software is so important and discuss the role of corporations as stewards of open source software. I'll also talk about how RStudio is structured and organized to pursue its mission of creating open source software for data science.<\/p> <p>** J.J. Allaire is a software engineer and entrepreneur who has created a wide variety of products including ColdFusion, Open Live Writer, Lose It!, and RStudio.<\/p> <p>* 19:00 Data, visualization, and designing with AI Keynote (Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg)<\/p> <p>** Recent progress in machine learning has raised a series of urgent questions: How can we train and debug deep learning models? How can we understand what is going on inside a neural network? And, perhaps most important, how can we design systems that serve people best? We'll show a series of examples from the People+AI Research (PAIR) initiative at Google--ranging from data visualizations for researchers, to tools for medical practitioners, to guidelines for designers--that illustrate how thinking carefully about data can lead to better tools, more effective design, and help humans and AI work together.<\/p> <p>** Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg are pioneers in data visualization and analytics. Their research has helped shape the field, and the systems they've built are used daily by millions of people. Fernanda and Martin are co-leaders of Google's PAIR (People + AI Research) initiative, which focuses on making AI technology broadly accessible and reflective of human values. Their prior work at Google has appeared on the Google search page, on YouTube, and in mission-critical internal data analytics tools.<\/p> <p>Before joining Google, at IBM Research, the two created the ground-breaking public visualization platform Many Eyes, which introduced visualization to millions of users worldwide. Viégas and Wattenberg are also known for visualization-based artwork, which has been exhibited in venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, London Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art.<\/p> <p>More about rstudio::conf 2020<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>rstudio::conf, the conference for all things R and RStudio, will take place January 29 and 30, 2020 in San Francisco, California.<\/p> <p>We're live streaming the keynotes so you don't need to go all the way to San Fran. 💪<\/p> <p>Link to conference website: <a href=\"https://rstudio.com/conference/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.com/conference/<\/a><\/p> ",

Being able to precisely estimate the potential duration of one’s disability is key to assessing future costs. At PartnerRe, we complement traditional actuarial reserving methods with predictive modelling. Our models make best use of all available data and are highly bespoke to the groups insured. In this talk, we will present our approach going from data to survival models to R-packages used for payments projections.<\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>Felix Reisen (UPC Switzerland)<br/>*Data Science at UPC*<br/>The telecommunication industry offers lots of opportunities for data science applications. Large customer bases, long lasting customer relationships and the digital nature of the products are the foundation for rich data sets which can be used to analyze the business and optimize processes with statistical methods. The area of applications range from targeted marketing &amp; sales, to call center optimizations, or predictive maintenance of the network. We will give a brief intro to our fully automated R based modeling environment along with a presentation on how the Advanced Analytics team at upc uses predictive modeling and data analytics to support the business in various fields.<\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>David Granjon (Novartis)<br/>*shinyMobile: mobile ready shiny apps*<br/>Have you ever dreamt of a template allowing you to build native looking IOS/Android Shiny apps? In the past months, the Shiny world received outstanding packages such as Golem (see it as the usethis of Shiny), shinyWidgets (interface customization), waiter (user feedbacks) or shinytest (functional testing) to bring our apps to the next level. Yet, very few efforts have been made to adapt Shiny on mobile devices, except miniUI. For two years, RinteRface soldiers (<a href=\"https://rinterface.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://rinterface.com<\/a>) strived to deliver a robust solution aiming at bridging the gap between desktop shiny apps and mobile ready user interfaces: welcome shinyMobile (<a href=\"https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile<\/a>). Discover 14 new input widgets (sliders, vertical sliders, steppers, grouped action buttons, toggles, picker, smart select, …), 2 themes (light and dark), 12 new widgets (expandable cards, badges, chips, timelines, gauges, progress bars, ...) combined with the power of server-side notifications such as alerts, modals, toasts, action sheets, sheets (and more) as well as 3 layouts (single, tabs and split): To follow the demo, you will need this link (RStudio Cloud account required): <a href=\"https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/46066/join?access_code=%2FM%2Fao0fdyAiWGsKuJaDJ%2BMyhayLiEItdzm2CXPq1\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/46066/join?access_code=%2FM%2Fao0fdyAiWGsKuJaDJ%2BMyhayLiEItdzm2CXPq1<\/a><\/p> <p>We are always looking for speakers, apéro sponsors, topic ideas and potential locations for our events.

    "description": "<p>A sales and marketing pipeline model tries to predict sales from a time series of observations associated with given accounts. The observations may have many features, importantly including labels of reasonably well-defined *stages* of the sales process. Salesforce conveniently exports such observations in easy to analyze form. Viewed through the right kind of lens, models like this look a bit like classical survival models. I'll talk a little about some models along these lines that I've been working on together with a friend.<\/p> <p>In order to make the models easy to use, we designed a shiny app. In order to make the app available to our clients, at least in beta form, we deployed it with Shinyproxy (and also Docker and Nginx), a tool that makes deploying Shiny apps pretty easy to do. I'll discuss this delightful deployment process.<\/p> <p>About Bryan:<br/>Bryan often thinks about mathematical approaches to simplifying the computation of large-scale problems. He's the coauthor with Taylor Arnold and Mike Kane of the new CRC Press textbook, \"A Computational Approach to Statistical Learning.\" His R packages include threejs and irlba, and he played a small role in the introduction of shiny.<\/p> ",

The BARUG meeting is not officially part of the conference, but we expect several RStudio team members to drop by.<\/p> <p>Agenda<br/>6:30 - Food and networking<br/>7:00 - Announcements<br/>7:05 - Sydeaka Watson - Neural Networks for Longitudinal Data Analysis<br/>7:35 - Bryan Lewis - Survival analysis, Salesforce, Shiny, and Shinyproxy<br/>8:05 - Max Kuhn - Creating a modeling package in 9 easy steps<\/p> <p>###########<br/>Sydeaka Watson<br/>Dr Watson will give a preview of her rstudio::conf talk:<br/>Neural Networks for Longitudinal Data Analysis<br/>Longitudinal data (or panel data) arise when observations are recorded on the same individuals at multiple points in time. For example, a longitudinal baseball study might track individual player characteristics (team affiliation, age, height, weight, etc.) and outcomes (batting average, stolen bases, runs, strikeouts, etc.) over multiple seasons, where the number of seasons could vary across players. Neural network frameworks such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) can flexibly accommodate this data structure while preserving and exploiting temporal relationships. In this presentation, we highlight the use of neural networks for longitudinal data analysis with tensorflow and keras in R.<\/p> <p>##########<br/>Bryan Lewis<br/>Survival analysis, Salesforce, Shiny, and Shinyproxy<br/>Part I<br/>A sales and marketing pipeline model tries to predict sales from a time series of observations associated with given accounts. The observations may have many features, importantly including labels of reasonably well-defined *stages* of the sales process. Salesfore conveniently exports such observations in easy to analyze form. Viewed through the right kind of lens, models like this look a bit like classical survival models. A friend of mine and I build some nice<br/>models along these lines. The first part of my talk briefly discusses such models.<\/p> <p>Part II<br/>In order to make the models easy to use, we designed a shiny app. In order to make the app available to our clients, at least in beta form, we deployed it with Shinyproxy (and also Docker and Nginx), a tool that makes deploying Shiny apps pretty easy to do. I'll discuss this delightful deployment process in this 2nd part.<\/p> <p>##########<br/>Max Kuhn<br/>I'll create that modeling package in 9 easy steps!<br/>Creating an R package can seem daunting. The {usethis} package has made this process much easier but, for modeling packages, the {hardhat} package can do even more. If you are new to R or experienced, {hardhat} can automatically create the interface code (i.e., formula, non-formula, ...) and populate S3 methods (such as predict) for you. I'll demonstrate this for a truly awful model in a live coding exercise.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Happy new year and welcome back everyone! Hope you've had a good break. Our R series of talks resumes again with our first talk of the year on a great topic about latent class modelling with R. Hope to see you there! As always, big thanks to Servian for hosting us.<\/p> <p>Rough agenda:<br/>5:45: Networking, food &amp; drinks<br/>6:15: Presentation<br/>7:15: More networking<br/>8:00: Close<\/p> <p>Practical Guide to Latent Class Models in R:<br/>How would you like a ML algorithm that can do both clustering and classification? Then Latent Class Models may be what you need.<br/>Latent stands for the idea of being \"hidden\" and Latent Class Models are a ML technique which sits in the family of mixture models. In the last couple of decades it has found it's way in the health, behavioural and the social sciences. It is a robust, data efficient and stable modeling technique which has been a great help in gaining insight to all sorts of science related questions. In the business world it has been used by marketing quants to segmentise customers and predict customer behavior. In this talk, we will do an introduction to latent class models, what they are, where do they sit in the available sets of statistical learning tools and how and what ways they can be used. We will illustrate these ideas using the R package called poLCA and briefly point also to its extended sister package called depmixS4.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Lito Cruz, has both an academic and IT industry background.

Traditionally, their analysis involved specialised software (and even specialised hardware); one aim of survey research in recent decades has been to make survey analysis relatively boring, so that it can be done safely by people with domain expertise. I will talk about the R survey package, which just had its 16th birthday. The package allows for exploratory analysis and modelling, and supports research into more efficient estimation in two-phase samples.<\/p> <p>About Thomas:<br/>Thomas Lumley is originally from Australia, and was at the University of Washington in Seattle for 15 years. He is now Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Auckland. His research interests include study design in epidemiology, semiparametric theory, computing and graphics, and genomics. Thomas blogs about statistics in the media at statschat.org.nz and about other topics at notstatschat.rbind.io. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand and the American Statistical Association, and a member of R Core, and has taught short courses on R in thirteen time zones.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> ",

The Ookla Data Science team hosts frequently used fact-finding tools and RMarkdown reports in a custom-built Shiny deployment. In the first half of the meetup, Ookla's Data Science team will discuss some of the challenges with building a limited feature version of Rstudio Connect then provide a functionality demo.<\/p> <p>Heather Nolis (Machine Learning Engineer at T-Mobile) and<br/>Jacqueline Nolis (Principal Data Scientist at Nolis, LLC):<br/>Making machine learning models is a core part of a data scientist’s job, but that work will only be well-received by executives if they can understand the models. The AI @ T-Mobile team has been lucky enough to get funding and people for our projects by convincing vice presidents to trust our work using fun, interactive Shiny demos with T-Mobile style and branding. In this talk we’ll cover our process of creating Shiny demos, the tools we use to make them look T-Mobile magenta, and the technology we use to quickly deploy them (spoiler, it involves Docker). We’ll also show off a few of the interactive demos we made with some audience participation.<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you at this sure to be fantastic meetup!<\/p> ",

In the first part of the presentation (~30min.), I will tell the origin story and development, with special attention given to the R work and lessons learned along the way. The second part of the presentation (~20min.) will be guided according to audience interest. I will take questions on any aspects of the project. I will have code and data on hand for demonstration. Sample data will be provided for audience explorations.<\/p> <p># Live-streaming &amp; Meeting Materials<br/>- All announcements and presentations will be live-streamed and recorded starting at 7:00 PM.

This talk will delve into why open source software is so important and discuss the role of corporations as stewards of open source software. I'll also talk about how RStudio is structured and organized to pursue its mission of creating open source software for data science.<\/p> <p>J.J. Allaire is a software engineer and entrepreneur who has created a wide variety of products including ColdFusion, Open Live Writer, Lose It!, and RStudio.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>*** Data, visualization, and designing with AI ***<\/p> <p>Recent progress in machine learning has raised a series of urgent questions: How can we train and debug deep learning models? How can we understand what is going on inside a neural network? And, perhaps most important, how can we design systems that serve people best? We'll show a series of examples from the People+AI Research (PAIR) initiative at Google--ranging from data visualizations for researchers, to tools for medical practitioners, to guidelines for designers--that illustrate how thinking carefully about data can lead to better tools, more effective design, and help humans and AI work together.<\/p> <p>Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg are pioneers in data visualization and analytics. Their research has helped shape the field, and the systems they've built are used daily by millions of people. Fernanda and Martin are co-leaders of Google's PAIR (People + AI Research) initiative, which focuses on making AI technology broadly accessible and reflective of human values. Their prior work at Google has appeared on the Google search page, on YouTube, and in mission-critical internal data analytics tools.<\/p> <p>Before joining Google, at IBM Research, the two created the ground-breaking public visualization platform Many Eyes, which introduced visualization to millions of users worldwide. Viégas and Wattenberg are also known for visualization-based artwork, which has been exhibited in venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, London Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Thanks to trivago for hosting &amp; sponsoring this edition of the Düsseldorf R User Group Meetup.

    "description": "<p>Abstract:<br/>Analysing complex sampling -- cluster samples, unequal probabilities, stratification -- used to be a separate and somewhat isolated area of statistics. Some books on the topic might have given the impression it was mostly about the care and feeding of subscripts. In fact, well-conducted complex sampling gives data with important differences from other data sources, but ones whose impact on the analysis is limited. Modern survey analysis software is aimed at reducing the differences to a minimum, so analysts and domain experts can analyse complex surveys correctly in most straightforward cases. I will talk about how you can use the R survey package to do most of the analyses you already do, but with data from complex surveys. ​<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Thomas Lumley is originally from Australia, but worked in Seattle, at the University of Washington, for 12 years. He is currently Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Auckland, where he teaches statistics and data science. Thomas is the developer of the R survey package, and a member of R Core.

In the first half of the meetup, Ookla's Data Science team will discuss some of the challenges with building a limited feature version of Rstudio Connect then provide a functionality demo.<\/p> <p>Heather Nolis (Machine Learning Engineer at T-Mobile) and<br/>Jacqueline Nolis (Principal Data Scientist at Nolis, LLC):<br/>Making machine learning models is a core part of a data scientist’s job, but that work will only be well-received by executives if they can understand the models. The AI @ T-Mobile team has been lucky enough to get funding and people for our projects by convincing vice presidents to trust our work using fun, interactive Shiny demos with T-Mobile style and branding. In this talk we’ll cover our process of creating Shiny demos, the tools we use to make them look T-Mobile magenta, and the technology we use to quickly deploy them (spoiler, it involves Docker). We’ll also show off a few of the interactive demos we made with some audience participation.<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you at this sure to be fantastic meetup!<\/p> <p>Please email/message Ellis Hughes if you have ideas for future Meetups you would like to see or organize.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>At this meetup we have an interesting presentation and training from Winston Saunders on data that is too large to fit into memory! We look forward to having you!<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>In 2019 the Washington Post successfully pursued a FOIA request for records of opiod shipments from the DEA's Automated Reporting System (ARCOS) spanning the height of the prescription opiod epidemic from 2006 to 2012. These data were subsequently published for 179 Million drug transactions ranging from mg to kilograms in size. While R's powerful analytical and visualization capabilities are, in principle, great for understanding the structure of the distribution network that enabled the epidemic, given the 78GB size of the dataset, efficient analysis required developing techniques, including data parsing and preparation of \"summary\" data sets, to dig deeply and thoroughly into the data. I'll share some of the techniques used to wrangle the raw data into more digestible summaries as well as the tools developed and the summaries themselves. We'll also explore how these summary data sets, coupled with mapping (ggmap), network analysis (network, igraph), and Shiny, can be used to reveal the magnitude the opiod epidemic and the network architecture, from manufacturer, to distributor, to consumer, that enabled it. To wrap up, we'll access one of the summary datasets and walk through a quick network visualization or mapping hands-on exercise. [To do the ggmaps mapping exercise you'll need your own API key from google]<\/p> <p>Biography:<br/>Winston is a data hackster with a day job. Though he first learned R in the Johns Hopkins Coursera pre-tidyverse he now enthusiastically embraces %&gt;% and, nine times in ten, chooses slice(1:10) over [1:10, ]. He’s explored ML, NLP, AI, image processing, web &amp; twitter bots, kaggle competitions, and lots of other applications in R. He selected his current project out of a balanced sense of responsibility and mischief.<\/p> <p>If you are wanting to have your own meetup to discuss the cool ways you are using R, reach out to Ellis Hughes via Meetup.com!<\/p> ",

Hence, there is often a conflict between accuracy and interpretability. We want the most accurate models but don’t want to sacrifice interpretability. In this talk, I discuss this conflict and some new methods in Machine Learning for interpreting ANY predictive model so you do not have to sacrifice predictive accuracy. A package (<a href=\"https://github.com/mt-edwards/xrayspecs\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/mt-edwards/xrayspecs<\/a>) is also introduced that provides these new methods for R programmers.<\/p> ",
