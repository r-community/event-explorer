The talk begins with a discussion of fundamental command-line topics like managing output streams, exit codes, and environment variables. After that, the talk will explain each argument to the \"Rscript\" executable. The talk will then describe how to write your own R programs that take in command-line arguments, using builtin functions like `commandArgs()` and external packages like {argparse} and {crayon}. The talk concludes with a demo of two R command-line interfaces used in the {lightgbm} project: one for running linting with {lintr} in continuous integration and one for building a C++ library using CMake. Sample code will be available on GitHub prior to and following the talk.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: James Lamb<\/p> <p>James Lamb is an engineer at Saturn Cloud, where he works on a team building a managed Dask + Kubernetes product. He is a maintainer on {lightgbm}, and has made many contributions to other open source data science projects, including {xgboost} and prefect. He is also a maintainer and co-author of two other packages on CRAN: {pkgnet} and {uptasticsearch}. He holds masters degrees in Applied Economics (2014) and Data Science (2018). Before joining Saturn, he worked as an IoT Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services and Uptake.<\/p> <p>**Talk 2**<\/p> <p>While working remotely, I often have client projects where RStudio is unavailable for data security reasons or otherwise.

If you would like to attend the event but the registration fee would put a financial strain on you, please reach out to [masked]. There are a limited number of complimentary tickets available.<\/p> <p># Abstract<\/p> <p>This workshop is meant to help data professionals transform raw data into compelling dashboards. We will use Tableau Public to learn how to create dashboard reports from a customer complaints dataset. This data will help you better understand the issues financial customers are experiencing with certain products. During this workshop, you can expect to learn how to use Tableau to ingest, transform, visualize, and use data to design a functional dashboard you can publish and share online. These dashboarding concepts can be used with varying types of datasets so you can quickly transform data into usable information. Attendees can expect to learn how to build dashboards in Tableau Public and use the free software to further develop their data visualization skills.<\/p> <p># Schedule<\/p> <p>6:30–6:45: Tableau Public Overview<br/>6:45–7:15: Exploratory Data Analysis<br/>7:15–7:45: Hands-On Exercises<br/>7:45-8:00: Break<br/>8:00–8:15: Dashboard Overview<br/>8:15–8:45: Measures and Visualizations<br/>8:45–9:15: Hands-On Exercises<br/>9:15–9:30: Tableau or Analytics QA<\/p> <p># Venue<\/p> <p>This event will be held on Zoom.

The idea is to motivate us to read books and discussing them together. This will help all of us to develop our skills.<\/p> <p>The format will be that the leader will prepare a short summary of the material and present it to the group. We will then discuss the material and do some exercises.<\/p> <p>The expectations are that you will attend regularly. If you cannot make a commitment to attend, please wait until the next book club starts. It is also expected that participants will take turns being the leader. The leader should prepare a summary of the material that was read and present it to the group.<\/p> <p>We will meet each week, Monday evening between 6:30 and 8:00 PM for six weeks.<\/p> <p>Book: Title: Text Mining with R<br/>Online: <a href=\"https://www.tidytextmining.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tidytextmining.com/<\/a><br/>Dead Tree: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491981652/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491981652/<\/a><\/p> <p>Signing up: When you sign-up you will be placed on the waiting list.

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<br/><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

It is expensive, has a high percentage of failure in programmes and this translates into a high societal cost. In this talk, we will give an overview of the world of how the BenevolentAI platform is trying to improve and speed up the process of drug discovery by using machine learning in different areas, focusing more in the area of chemistry.<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://ml-in-drug.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://ml-in-drug.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Ana Solaguren-Beascoa Negre<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ana-Solaguren-Beascoa\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ana-Solaguren-Beascoa<\/a><\/p> <p>Ana studied physics at University of Barcelona and did her PhD in theoretical particle physics at the TUM - max plank institut fuer physik.

It predicts customer behaviour through data-driven insights to enable the business to acquire new customers<br/>intelligently. The key problem with most of the companies is not just to acquire more customers, but it is to acquire the right customers and retain them. Companies consider the cost of customer acquisition as an important measure in evaluating how much value a customer will bring to their businesses. DON will empower teams such as Customer Value<br/>Management, Marketing, Sales, Continuous Improvement and more via interactive dashboards available in real-time.<br/>These dashboards will enable research, and the understanding of market trends and behaviours. The demonstration of the app is based on the utility sector. However, the data is anonymised for the solution but depicts the real-life problem.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event is kindly sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

However, they often struggle with increasingly larger data volumes, reverting back to bottlenecking data access to manage large numbers of data engineering requests and rising data warehousing costs. To address this, a next-gen cloud data lake architecture has emerged that brings together the best attributes of the data warehouse and the data lake. This new open data architecture is built to maximize data access with minimal data movement and no data copies.<\/p> <p>- How “no data copy” approach dramatically streamlines data workflows while reducing security and governance overhead<br/>- Why agile development concepts, when applied to the data tier, can dramatically increase data engineering agility<br/>- How to separate compute and data by preserving data in open file and table formats<br/>- How a next-generation cloud data lake architecture brings together the best attributes of data warehouse and data lakes to truly democratize data<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://apache-arrow-datalake.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://apache-arrow-datalake.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Viktor Kessler<br/>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktor-kessler/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktor-kessler/<\/a><br/>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ViktorKessler\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/ViktorKessler<\/a><\/p> <p>Viktor Kessler is Senior Solutions Architect at Dremio and a ex-MongoDB Senior Solutions Architect.<\/p> <p>### ABOUT THE X-EUROPE DATA SCIENCE WEBINARS<\/p> <p>X-Europe Webinar Series is a joint online event of Vienna Data Science Group, Frankfurt Data Science, Budapest Data Science Meetup, BCN Analytics, Budapest.AI, Barcelona Data Science and Machine Learning Meetup, Budapest Deep Learning Reading Seminar, Warsaw R Users Group, PyData Slovakia, and Data Scientists Ireland.<\/p> ",

This type of work often involves trade processing, trade confirmation, and settlement of payments. In many institutions, much of this work is done manually using excel spreadsheets. This presentation will focus on how someone in the back-office can use R to automate manual processes and how they might convince others on their team to join the journey.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Mandip Mistry is a Business Analyst at the Health Care of Ontario Pension Plan. In his role, he is responsible for enhancements and ongoing support of HOOPP's internal stress testing system which provides risk reporting to a variety of stakeholders within the organization. Before this, he spent 5 years in Investment Operations (aka back-office) helping automate manual excel processes while developing a healthy obsession for all things R.

    "description": "<p>In R we can do a lot with data tables. There are plenty of ways to import tabular data and then transform it for our needs. Lately, there’s been an explosion of new R packages that allow us to take these data tables and make them presentable in publication contexts. A package Rich Iannone has been working on, called gt, is great for taking a data frame and making it look good (and more like a table you’d find on the web or in print).

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>My list of publications can also give you the big picture of my research activities:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

Please see event details below:<br/>----------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Alastair Rushworth (Tesco Bank)<\/p> <p>Title: Exploring EDA with R<\/p> <p>Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (aka EDA) is one of the most important tools in the data scientist’s toolkit, while also being one of the hardest to codify and teach. EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modelling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk). Since completing his PhD in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London in 2011, Matthew has worked in technical and non-technical roles in academia, the commercial sector, and the public sector - with a focus on managing diverse stakeholders and developing data-driven products and solutions.<\/p> ",

In this webinar I'll discuss some approaches and potential pitfalls to analysing legislative debate, using the British House of Commons as an example.<\/p> <p>Biography: Evan Odell is a junior data consultant at Pandata and R programmer, based in Berlin. Evan has written numerous R packages, primarily for accessing and processing data, and created a dataset of UK House of Commons speeches available as a single RDS or CSV file. He has previously worked for Disability Rights UK, Queen's University and as a freelancer for London Business School.<\/p> ",

The talk begins with a discussion of fundamental command-line topics like managing output streams, exit codes, and environment variables. After that, the talk will explain each argument to the \"Rscript\" executable. The talk will then describe how to write your own R programs that take in command-line arguments, using builtin functions like `commandArgs()` and external packages like {argparse} and {crayon}. The talk concludes with a demo of two R command-line interfaces used in the {lightgbm} project: one for running linting with {lintr} in continuous integration and one for building a C++ library using CMake. Sample code will be available on GitHub prior to and following the talk.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: James Lamb<\/p> <p>James Lamb is an engineer at Saturn Cloud, where he works on a team building a managed Dask + Kubernetes product. He is a maintainer on {lightgbm}, and has made many contributions to other open source data science projects, including {xgboost} and prefect. He is also a maintainer and co-author of two other packages on CRAN: {pkgnet} and {uptasticsearch}. He holds masters degrees in Applied Economics (2014) and Data Science (2018). Before joining Saturn, he worked as an IoT Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services and Uptake.<\/p> <p>**Talk 2**<\/p> <p>While working remotely, I often have client projects where RStudio is unavailable for data security reasons or otherwise.

In addition to demonstrating how to go from R Markdown to web-based slides with xaringan, in this talk I'll show you how to completely customize the appearance of your slides with xaringanthemer, a package that lets you quickly create a complete slide theme from only a few color choices. Then we'll go beyond appearances with a variety of addins and extensions from the xaringanExtra package, including: a tiled slide overview, editable slides, embedded webcam videos, tabbed panels, extra styles, shareable and embeddable slides, animations, and real time slide broadcasting.<\/p> <p>About Garrick:<br/>Garrick Aden-Buie is a Data Science Educator at RStudio and lives in sunny St. Petersburg, Florida. His passion is to combine creative coding with programming education, using code to build tools that teach coding to new and advanced R users alike. Like tidyexplain: a project that used ggplot2 and gganimate to reimagine database operations as colorful flying boxes instead of the typical Venn diagrams. Garrick has developed a number of open source addins and packages for RStudio—such as regexplain, shrtcts and rsthemes—and is always easily distracted by projects that combine R Markdown and online learning or teaching.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EST and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>Amal Saadallah works as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). Her main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining, also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>Her list of publications can also give you the big picture of her research activities:<br/><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Alastair Rushworth (Tesco Bank)<\/p> <p>Title: Exploring EDA with R<\/p> <p>Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (aka EDA) is one of the most important tools in the data scientist’s toolkit, while also being one of the hardest to codify and teach. EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modelling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk).

The range of functionalities has expanded and some very interesting extensions have been created. There is the officedown package that increases the layout capabilities of R Markdown when the output is Word, the rvg package to create editable vector graphics, the flextable package to make nice tables.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, you will see how to use the package to produce PowerPoint presentations and Word documents. Its role as a foundation for other packages and new documentation will be discussed. It will also be an opportunity for David to present the officedown package for the first time.<\/p> <p>## Speaker<\/p> <p>David Gohel is the founder of ArData, a French company providing R expertise, R training and consulting in data sciences. He is the author of R packages, most popular are officer, flextable, rvg and ggiraph.<\/p> <p>He is a data scientist and software engineer. His professional experiences led him to face many challenges related to the data of organizations, which he has always managed with solutions involving R software.<\/p> ",

The talk begins with a discussion of fundamental command-line topics like managing output streams, exit codes, and environment variables. After that, the talk will explain each argument to the \"Rscript\" executable. The talk will then describe how to write your own R programs that take in command-line arguments, using builtin functions like `commandArgs()` and external packages like {argparse} and {crayon}. The talk concludes with a demo of two R command-line interfaces used in the {lightgbm} project: one for running linting with {lintr} in continuous integration and one for building a C++ library using CMake. Sample code will be available on GitHub prior to and following the talk.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: James Lamb<\/p> <p>James Lamb is an engineer at Saturn Cloud, where he works on a team building a managed Dask + Kubernetes product. He is a maintainer on {lightgbm}, and has made many contributions to other open source data science projects, including {xgboost} and prefect. He is also a maintainer and co-author of two other packages on CRAN: {pkgnet} and {uptasticsearch}. He holds masters degrees in Applied Economics (2014) and Data Science (2018). Before joining Saturn, he worked as an IoT Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services and Uptake.<\/p> <p>**Talk 2**<\/p> <p>While working remotely, I often have client projects where RStudio is unavailable for data security reasons or otherwise.

We continue our meetups with #goodRvibes and a speaker you'll definitely enjoy!<\/p> <p>Three reasons to use tidymodels with Julia Silge<\/p> <p>Modeling and machine learning in R involve a bewildering array of heterogeneous packages, and establishing good statistical practice is challenging in any language. The tidymodels (tidymodels.org) collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, we’ll focus on three specific reasons to consider using tidymodels. We will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering.<\/p> <p>Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC where she works on open source modeling tools. She is an author, an international keynote speaker, and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice. Julia loves text analysis, making beautiful charts, and communicating about technical topics with diverse audiences.<\/p> <p>Registration is free, but mandatory via meetup. We shall meet on zoom, and the link will be updated on the day of the event ( PIN for entrance should be sent by email ~2hours before meeting start).<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>CODE OF CONDUCT :<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a><br/>Please read our Code of Conduct before your first participation.<\/p> ",

She received her Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles. Her area of expertise includes design of experiments, statistical methods and applications, survey methods, and discrete choice experiments. Her recent projects include the development of a new class of experimental designs that provide higher efficiency, more in-depth analyses, and require a shorter time to run. This research has led to multiple interdisciplinary funded projects.<\/p> <p>Abstract: As science and technology progress, this often calls for innovation in methodological and theoretical development of statistical experimental design, an essential aspect for research in any discipline. This research concentrates on the close connection between statistics and medicine, and the development of novel experiments to maximize efficiency, while minimizing time and costs. The focus of this talk will be on an application of an undergraduate research project using a novel experimental design known as an Orthogonal Array Composite Design (OACD) with applications to KB oral cancer. In particular, this talk will highlight the methods and applications that undergraduate students contributed to. Furthermore, various takeaways will be presented in terms of tips, challenges, and benefits in working with undergraduate students. sources.<\/p> <p># Modernizing Design of Experiment Output with Tidyverse<br/>Speaker: Jose Toledo<br/>Graduate Student, Statistics Dept, CSU Fullerton<\/p> <p>Bio: Jose is currently in his last semester in the Master’s in statistics program at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), where he is also a teaching associate. Additionally, he is a part-time data analyst at Southern California Coast Water Project. His research interest is in the field of Design of Experiments, where he has worked on projects such as drug combination treatments for KB oral cancer and recently in tuberculosis. During his summer breaks he enjoys mentoring undergraduate students in local community colleges and providing them research opportunities early in their education.<\/p> <p>Abstract: Most Design of Experiment (DoE) experts will agree that using FrF2 is the most comprehensive R package for generating two-level factorial designs as well as Plackett-Burman type screening designs. Similarly, for sequential optimization with first order and second order response surface models, that offer optimization approaches like steepest ascent and visualization of the response function for linear model objects, the package rsm is highly recommended. However, their graphical outputs are limited and can benefit from the current “trends” in R such as implementing graphics using ggplot2. This talk will focus on the development of an R package, ggDoE, which focuses on the visualization of DoE using ggplot2. Examples will be taken from a TB drug combination experiment and demonstrate the output of commonly used methods in DoE. These methods include but are not limited to: factorial effect plots, half-normal plots, Lenth’s method, fitting second-order models and their corresponding contour plots.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>R-Ladies Toolbox Series - Essentials for women and minority genders in academia, science and data analysis presents:<\/p> <p>Reproducibility by Charles Grey (R-Ladies Remote)<\/p> <p>Talk Abstract:<br/>As scientists, it's desirable to demonstrate to others (including our future selves) that our computational scientific work validates the claims we make in published research. Being able to reproduce the work is a key component of easily validating an analysis, as well as extending the work. Reproducibility is not as simple, however, as sharing the code and data that produced our analysis. We must consider how our data and algorithms are understood, variables defined, etc. Our code needs to be accessible and interoperable. There is much guidance about best practice, but this is often overwhelming for those of us who are not from formal computer science training. In this talk I share the story of how I attempted good enough practice in my doctoral thesis, and found even this was simply too much to achieve. Indeed, despite failing to achieve good enough scientific practice in any aspect of reproducibility, I discovered a delightful world of scientific workflows in R that make every day just that bit easier now. Failing at reproducible science in R is the best we can aim for; we will never achieve best practice in every aspect of reproducibility, and if we failed, then we tried. Through this process we discover useful tools to make the next time easier.<\/p> <p>BIO:<br/>Charles T. Gray is a postdoc with the evidence synthesis lab at Newcastle University. She is currently specialising in Bayesian network meta-analysis in Cochrane intervention reviews. She has three degrees: arts, music, and mathematics. None of these prepared her for her interdisciplinary computational metascience doctoral thesis in R.<\/p> <p>Calling all students, academics, and women in science! R-Ladies Freiburg presents a five-part guest series aimed at women and gender minorities in academia, science and data analysis, from first semester students to tenured researchers. Leading R-Ladies from around the world will lead us through the most fundamental steps to studying and working in academia, from analyzing results, to presenting them clearly, ensuring their reproducibility, and keeping track of all your changes. The series will close with a panel discussion from women around the world, who will speak about their experiences with science.<\/p> <p>This series is funded by the “Pädagogische Hochschule Freiburg”, the University of Education in Freiburg.<\/p> <p>Participants who take part in all five meetups can receive a certificate of participation.<\/p> <p>Everyone is welcome to join and we hope for a warm exchange between students and researchers, as well as R-Ladies from the wider community.<\/p> ",

    "title": "AthensR: “Towards automating Time Series Forecasting Using R” with Amal SAADALLAH  [Virtual] , Greece, Europe",
    "group": "AthensR",
    "start": "2021-03-04",
    "description": "<p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Both complex and dynamic evolving nature of time series data make forecasting among one of the most important and challenging tasks in time series analysis. Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>My list of publications can also give you the big picture of my research activities:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

The range of functionalities has expanded and some very interesting extensions have been created. There is the officedown package that increases the layout capabilities of R Markdown when the output is Word, the rvg package to create editable vector graphics, the flextable package to make nice tables.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, you will see how to use the package to produce PowerPoint presentations and Word documents. Its role as a foundation for other packages and new documentation will be discussed. It will also be an opportunity for David to present the officedown package for the first time.<\/p> <p>## Speaker<\/p> <p>David Gohel is the founder of ArData, a French company providing R expertise, R training and consulting in data sciences. He is the author of R packages, most popular are officer, flextable, rvg and ggiraph.<\/p> <p>He is a data scientist and software engineer.

Reply to this email ([masked]) to confirm<\/p> <p>Talk details<br/>Speaker: Gordana Popovic, University of New South Wales<\/p> <p>Topic: How to see the forest from the trees: Removing pesky artefacts from discrete data for better visualisation<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data sometimes have artefacts which obscure the patterns we are interested in visualising. You may have come across this when trying to interpret a residual plot from a logistic regression. For discrete data, these are not really artefacts, they are properties of the distribution of the data, like mean-variance relationships and lots of zeros. Generalised linear models and their extensions model the distribution of the data, including these properties, and so are a good way to remove them, to better see the patterns we are actually interested in. I will talk though some concepts and lots of examples of how we can use models to get the best out of our visualisations of discrete multivariate data in R.<\/p> <p>Biography: Gordana is a statistical consultant and research fellow at UNSW Sydney, with research interests in modelling and visualising multivariate discrete data in ecology. In her spare time, Gordana can be found hiking or ocean swimming (poorly but enthusiastically).<\/p> <p>Website link: <a href=\"https://statsoc.org.au/event-4144562?CalendarViewType=1&amp;SelectedDate=2/15/2021\" class=\"linkified\">https://statsoc.org.au/event-4144562?CalendarViewType=1&amp;SelectedDate=2/15/2021<\/a><\/p> ",

I specifically look at 24 hours of recordings of talk about Type 1 Diabetes relative to Tweets within the context of the diabetes online community. This comparison allows us to assess how representative the concerns raised in the conversations are of the world-wide discourses around Type 1 Diabetes on English-language Twitter, and in how far they are specific to the participants or to the location these participants are from.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Does it have to look like a 90’s website? Introduction to CSS and HTML for styling interactive outputs in R<\/p> <p>### Elliot Meador<\/p> <p>In this talk we will review some easy wins when it comes to styling interactive outputs in R, including Shiny web applications and flexdashboards. Specifically, we’ll discuss Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and how they can be used to add some pizazz to the base Shiny and flexdashboards. We will then discuss layouts and workflows that are best suited for styling your interactive R outputs.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>/federico<\/p> ",

It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.<\/p> <p>Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”<\/p> <p>Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed..<\/p> <p>PS This book is available free online: <a href=\"https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/<\/a><\/p> ",

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes.

EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modelling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic.

They can be used to identify popular topics among different legislators, reveal party factions that do not show up in voting behaviour, and longitudinal changes in the language used to discuss certain topics, amongst other things. In this webinar I'll discuss some approaches and potential pitfalls to analysing legislative debate, using the British House of Commons as an example.<\/p> <p>Biography: Evan Odell is a junior data consultant at Pandata and R programmer, based in Berlin. Evan has written numerous R packages, primarily for accessing and processing data, and created a dataset of UK House of Commons speeches available as a single RDS or CSV file.

À ce titre, la Data Science a fait son entrée dans le monde médical par l'intermédiaire d'algorithmes de Machine Learning et de Deep Learning ainsi que des méthodes d'analyse statistique. Un réseau bayésien est un modèle probabiliste utilisé pour représenter les relations de dépendance conditionnelle (et dans certains cas de causalité) entre différentes variables.

As a bonus. we will kick off the event with an informative lightning talk about classification and regression trees given by Praveena Matthews!<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Lightning talk title: Classification and Regression Trees<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Praveena Mathews teaches R for GraduateTutor.com.

An after-thought or as place-holders for numbers. For me, tables are the sexiest visualizations in the Viz world; a good table conveys more to me through its simplicity than the sometimes confusing array of colors, shapes and sizes of a plot.<\/p> <p>Bio: I am a data engineer at Converging Health who is a also a bench-trained PhD scientist.

In this workshop, you will learn how to use R and R tools to create, load, plot, and analyze spatial data using an example that explores how animals are influenced by the physical world around them. Then, you will learn how to use R Shiny to display your data and analysis on an interactive web app ready for the internet.<br/>This workshop is aimed at attendees with beginner or higher level of programming experience in either R or another programming language. Attendees will benefit from familiarity with the concepts of assigning variables, subsetting arrays/matrices/data tables, and using predefined functions in their language of choice; but those unfamiliar with these concepts are welcome to follow along to see an example of what R can do!<\/p> <p>Jori Harrison is a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary where she studies how ecological factors influence environmental DNA.

    "description": "<p>Alastair Rushworth (Tesco Bank)<\/p> <p>Title: Exploring EDA with R<\/p> <p>Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (aka EDA) is one of the most important tools in the data scientist’s toolkit, while also being one of the hardest to codify and teach. EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modeling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk). Since completing his PhD in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London in 2011, Matthew has worked in technical and non-technical roles in academia, the commercial sector, and the public sector - with a focus on managing diverse stakeholders and developing data-driven products and solutions.<\/p> ",

Here is my proposal:<\/p> <p>- Gather a small group of 2-5 and learn together.<br/>- Meet at a coffee shop, library, or some other space that has Wi-Fi.<br/>- Pick a project, data set or problem, then work to solve it with different tools.<br/>- Keep it fluid and informal.<br/>- Meet on a regular basis, say weekly to start, and adjust as needed.<br/>- Aim to keep the meetings 2-4 hours long, but this can be adjusted to the project or group. People can come and go as needed.<br/>- It does not have to be the same people each time, so you only have to commit to going once to check it out.<\/p> <p>Are you interested? Show up at the meeting spot, have some coffee, meet new friends and bring a project or question.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>MEETUP DESCRIPTION<\/p> <p>Privacy concerns have been growing over the last 20 years as companies collect more data about their customers. Synthetic data has exploded in popularity as a tool for anonymization, due to its benefits of preserving statistical relationships while severely reducing the risk of re-identification. Generating synthetic data is easy with many companies offering solutions alongside an active research field constantly publishing new algorithms. When you start to work with synthetic data, many questions arise over the accuracy and privacy-preserving characteristics of your synthetic data.<\/p> <p>In this talk, we will go over a few topics. We outline why privacy is<br/>important and how synthetic data prevails over many classical<br/>anonymization techniques. Next, we look at open source tools in<br/>measuring the quality of a synthetic dataset. Leading into our next<br/>topic of introducing VirtualDataLab, a Python open source tool<br/>developed by MOSTLY AI. (Me included!) Lastly, we go over some best practices for picking a synthetic data generator.<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://synthetic-data-privacy.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://synthetic-data-privacy.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Victoria Tran<br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vickictran/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/vickictran/<\/a><\/p> <p>Victoria is a data scientist for MOSTLY AI, a synthetic data startup<br/>based in Vienna, Austria.

Participants will work in teams to \"hack\" through the data and will present their work at the end of the event for prizes. You are free to create your own team, or we will assist in team creation if you do not have one. This is a great way to network, share, and learn from others.<\/p> <p>The main goal of the hackathon is to promote teamwork and foster education and learning in a welcoming environment. Though teams will be competing to present their best work at the end of the event for prizes, communication and providing assistance across teams is highly encouraged. We will provide in-person training during the hackathon and online training prior to the event.<\/p> <p>We have set up a GitHub repository that has more information about the hackathon. Such as the schedule; setting up slack and much more. Further information will be provided prior to the event.<\/p> <p>All participants must abide by the OCRUG Code of Conduct and R Consortium Code of Conduct.<\/p> <p>This will be an online event.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Speaker: Dr. Krisztian Magori<\/p> <p>Title: Using R to analyze and model COVID-19 cases<\/p> <p>Abstract: Many years from now, we will all think back to what we were doing during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how we contributed to resolving it. In my presentation, I will show you three small projects I conducted related to the pandemic, and look for your feedback. First, I analyzed COVID-19 case trends across the State of Washington, particularly in Spokane, in order for myself to see behind daily case counts, and still looking for ways to expand that. Second, I tested the oft-heard suggestion that increased case numbers in the fall of 2020 were simply due to increased testing, using bootstrapping methods. Finally, I developed a stochastic, spatially explicit model to simulate COVID-19 transmission within a facility, such as a dorm, with visualization conducted in R.<\/p> <p>Speaker Profile: Krisztian Magori,Ph.D., is a Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Department of Biology at Eastern Washington University. He teaches biostatistics using R at both the undergraduate and graduate level, and consults with faculty and students on statistical analysis of their datasets. In addition, he is a disease ecologist, focusing on ticks and mosquitoes, when we don't have a pandemic that's more important.<\/p> ",

Such a graphical representation is convenient, since, for high-dimensional problems the local interpretation of a subset of variables can be interpreted in the sub-graph induced by these variables and variables connected to these. By exploiting the graph-theoretic representation, general algorithms can be used for computing marginal and conditional probabilities. For problems large enough, it can be impossible to compute such probabilities without exploiting the graphical representation. Of particular importance for calculations of probabilities in graphical models is the Junction Tree Algorithm (JTA).<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>We're happy to have a wonderful speaker and topic to start our first virtual meetup. Abed W Ayyad (<a href=\"https://manipulativegerbil.blogspot.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://manipulativegerbil.blogspot.com/<\/a>) will share his exploration of solar PV and how R can be used for solar PV in Alberta.<\/p> <p>Solar energy converted to electricity (photovoltaic, or PV, electricity) seems almost too good to be true when it comes to thinking about ways of reducing global carbon emissions. According to a widely repeated claim, one hour's worth of the solar radiation which falls on the earth's surface could meet human energy needs for one year. Though impressive and technically \"correct\", this is far from being a practical or meaningful calculation. So how much carbon-neutral electricity could someone sitting in the Canadian prairies actually harvest from the sunshine falling on their backyard?<\/p> <p>R lends itself perfectly to the data intensive task of planning and predicting the amount of solar insolation which falls on a given location, and the electricity which one can expect to harvest from it. Following a (very) broad introduction to solar energy and photovoltaics, we will explore a number of packages available in R which make it possible to access and analyse publicly available data on solar insolation, and to understand what this might mean in terms of solar PV potential at a site in Alberta. We will accomplish the latter by doing a walk-through of an example using the nasapower package available in CRAN, as well as a number of the graphics and GIS-related packages also available in R. This talk, aimed at a wide audience of R users, will illustrate why Alberta is a surprisingly perfect location for solar PV deployment and how you can convince yourself of that using R.<\/p> <p>About the speaker: Abed has used R in a variety of settings for seven years now, for GIS/cartography applications, data analysis and linear optimisation. There are many reasons to love R, but the community of users is definitely one of the biggest. Last September, Edmonton became the 10th city which Abed has called home during his life. Abed is looking forward to discovering more of the city, and to cycling to some parks and lakes as the summer goes on and the days get longer.<\/p> ",

It is designed to be suitable for low-level system programming with high performance and low overhead while providing modern abstractions and protection from undefined behavior. The most common application scenarios for Rust are those that otherwise might be suitable for C or C++. As such, Rust may be a good choice for writing extensions to high-level interactive languages such as R. The extendr project was founded with the goal to make writing Rust extensions to R as easy and painless as possible. At the same time, extendr also enables the reverse use case, writing standalone Rust programs that call R code and take advantage of the R runtime. This talk will provide an overview of the extendr API and its key design choices, and it will highlight simple use cases and known pitfalls. The talk is meant primarily as an introduction to Rust for current R users. However, experienced Rust programmers who want to branch out into data science and statistical programming may also find this talk helpful.<\/p> <p>About Claus:<br/>Claus Wilke is the Jane and Roland Blumberg Centennial Professor in Molecular Evolution at The University of Texas at Austin. He holds a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Bochum in Germany, and he received postdoctoral training in biological physics in the lab of Chris Adami at Caltech. Claus Wilke has published extensively in the areas of computational biology, evolutionary biology, protein biochemistry, and virology. He has also authored several popular R packages used for data visualization, such as cowplot, ggridges, and ggtext, and he is a regular contributor to the package ggplot2.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EDT and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

This holds especially true once you've found a workaround for doing something particular because you're little likely to search for more efficient ways of handling that matter. In our experience, the best way to learn the little things that make an impact is through other useRs.<\/p> <p>For our April meetup, we would like to draw from the experiences of other useRs' and ask each of the participants to show their favorite thing about R or RStudio. Whether it's an underused feature, a package, a function or a shortcut you discovered - let us know! If it is a brand new feature of the latest version of R or RStudio – we're happy to hear about it!<\/p> <p>There is no need to prepare a fancy presentation on something highly sophisticated. Just take a minute and think about the things that you really like and want others to know about. As always, R users of all levels of expertise are welcome.

Cependant, même une fois passé·e au-delà de “Bonjour Monde”, vous continuerez régulièrement à avoir des problèmes dans R… Triste constat ? Non, car vous apprendrez aussi à devenir un·e utilisateur·rice de R résilient·e !<br/>Dans cette présentation je partagerai des astuces à cet effet : comment suivre les nouveautés de R sans se sentir submergé·e ; et comment et où demander de l’aide efficacement. J’espère que chacun·e repartira avec quelques clés de plus pour une utilisation joyeuse de R !<\/p> <p>L'oratrice :<\/p> <p>Maëlle Salmon est actuellement Research Software Engineer chez rOpenSci. Mais ce n'est pas tout ! Maëlle est également très impliquée dans la communauté R puisqu'elle travaille sur beaucoup d'autres projets en tant que developpeuse et/ou formatrice en R. Pour ne citer qu'eux : elle a notamment contribué à la création du livre \"HTTP testing in R\", est à l'origine du blog R-hub et assure la gestion du compte twitter R-Ladies Global. Nous sommes donc ravi·e·s de l'avoir parmi nous pour ce premier meet up de l'année 2021.<\/p> ",

They maintain the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. They nourish other living organisms and supply psychological benefits to humans as well, improving our moods and beautifying the landscape around us. But plants don’t just passively provide. They also take action.<\/p> <p>Beronda L. Montgomery explores the vigorous, creative lives of organisms often treated as static and predictable. In fact, plants are masters of adaptation. They “know” what and who they are, and they use this knowledge to make a way in the world. Plants experience a kind of sensation that does not require eyes or ears. They distinguish kin, friend, and foe, and they are able to respond to ecological competition despite lacking the capacity of fight-or-flight. Plants are even capable of transformative behaviors that allow them to maximize their chances of survival in a dynamic and sometimes unfriendly environment.<\/p> <p>Lessons from Plants enters into the depth of botanic experience and shows how we might improve human society by better appreciating not just what plants give us but also how they achieve their own purposes. What would it mean to learn from these organisms, to become more aware of our environments and to adapt to our own worlds by calling on perception and awareness? Montgomery’s meditative study puts before us a question with the power to reframe the way we live: What would a plant do?<\/p> ",
