    "description": "<p>***Bring your laptop***<\/p> <p># Introduction<\/p> <p>This month this we are going to try something new and break from our traditional two talks. Michael Espero is going to introduce the 'reticulate' package. Reticulate provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. The package includes facilities for:<\/p> <p>* Calling Python from R in a variety of ways including R Markdown, sourcing Python scripts, importing Python modules, and using Python interactively within an R session.<\/p> <p>* Translation between R and Python objects (for example, between R and Pandas data frames, or between R matrices and NumPy arrays).<\/p> <p>* Flexible binding to different versions of Python including virtual environments and Conda environments.<\/p> <p>Reticulate embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling seamless, high-performance interoperability. If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, reticulate can dramatically streamline your workflow!<\/p> <p>Come early, network and enjoy the food. Do not forget your laptop with R and Python installed.<\/p> <p># Schedule<\/p> <p>6:30 - 6:50 Networking<br/>6:50 - 7:00 Welcome &amp; general announcement<br/>7:00 - 8:00 Michael Espero: talk and tutorial<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Networking and Clean-up<\/p> ",

Osoby korzystające z niego nierzadko nie mają doświadczenia jako programiści. Kiedy kody które piszą stają się coraz bardziej skomplikowane, pojawia się problem zarządzania nimi, a także ich przejrzystości i stabilności. W ciągu 2-3 spotkań chcę opowiedzieć o narzędziach, pakietach i praktykach, które mogą pomóc w tym, aby tworzyć lepsze oprogramowanie. Na pierwszym spotkaniu chcę poruszyć kwestie ,,podstawowe”<\/p> <p>1. Tworzenie pakietów, dokumentacja w roxygen, ,,package check” w pakiecie devtools<br/>2. Automatyczne sprawdzenia i naprawa składni za pomocą pakietów usethis, lintr i styler<br/>3. Testowanie kodu za pomocą pakietów usethis i testthat<br/>4. Kontrola wersji (git, GitHub) (temat opcjonalny jeśli starczy nam czasu)<\/p> <p>Spotkanie będzie miało charakter warsztatowy dlatego jest bardzo ważne, żeby przynieść własne komputery. Polecam mieć zainstalowane RStudio oraz pakiety: install.packages(c(\"devtools\", \"usethis\", \"testthat\", \"lintr\", \"styler\", \"pkgKitten”, \"roxygen2”)).<\/p> <p>A także git-a<br/>- Windows: <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/download/win\" class=\"linkified\">http://git-scm.com/download/win<\/a><br/>- OS X: <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/download/mac\" class=\"linkified\">http://git-scm.com/download/mac<\/a><br/>- Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install git-core<\/p> ",

With a view to address this, we have provisionally booked rooms to host these sessions, starting on a bi-monthly basis.<\/p> <p>To keep things interesting, the first 15 minutes of each session will be a demonstration of a R package. On Monday, we’ll demonstrate how to generate a reproducible example of a problem that can then be shared on an online users help forum. To do this we will be using the reprex and datapasta R packages. The floor will then be opened up for attendees to ask for help, share tips, identify resources and generally discuss ways of improving how we use R.<\/p> <p>So if you’re a new user interesting in getting tips on where to place that next step or you are more experienced and have a coding problem you need help solving, we look forward to meeting you on Monday.<\/p> ",

W efekcie, rozbudziło to oczekiwania sektora biznesowego co do zakresu w jakim Sztuczna Inteligencja jest w stanie zastąpić pracowników w ich codziennej pracy. Podczas wykładu opowiem o projekcie cyfryzacji kontraktów który prowadzę od ponad roku. Celem projektu jest stworzenie narzędzia umożliwiającego automatyczne zarządzanie i analizę kontraktów zawieranych przez firmę. W tym celu przetestowaliśmy i wykorzystujemy najnowsze (jak i odrobinę starsze) techniki uczenia maszynowego, typu BERT, czy CatBoost, jak i zaadoptowaliśmy podejście Active Learning w uczeniu SI rozpoznawania nowych klauzul umownych. Wykład ma na celu omówienie głównych założeń projektu, zaprezentowanie naszego podejścia i przedstawienie użytych technik uczenia maszynowego.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Doktor nauk technicznych specjalizujący się w zaawansowanej analizie danych (Data Science). Absolwent Polsko-Japońskiej Akademii Technik Komputerowych (dr, informatyka) i Szkoły Głównej Handlowej (mgr, metody ilościowe w ekonomii i systemy informacyjne). Były konsultant McKinsey, obecnie Product Owner w firmie Nokia specjalizujący się w prowadzeniu projektów automatyzujących skomplikowane procesy biznesowe (w szczególności przy wykorzystaniu technik sztucznej inteligencji i przetwarzania języka naturalnego) i zarządzający dużymi zespołami eksperckimi.<\/p> <p>Temat #2<\/p> <p>Mówca: Mateusz Staniak<br/>Temat: Szybka i zautomatyzowana eksploracja danych w R (autoEDA).<\/p> <p>Abstrakt:<br/>Czyszczenie i eksploracja danych to kluczowe elementy procesu analitycznego, które wpływają zarówno na jakość budowanych modeli predykcyjnych/statystycznych, jak i zrozumienie problemu biznesowego i charakterystyki danych.<br/>W R, i w innych językach do analizy danych, powstaje coraz więcej narzędzi, które mają na celu jak najmocniej przyspieszyć i zautomatyzować eksplorację danych. Do najważniejszych przykładów należą pakiety DataExplorer i dataMaid.<br/>Opowiem o ogólnych metodach i pakietach R-owych, które pomagają ograniczyć ilość pisanego kodu i zautomatyzować typowe elementy eksploracji danych.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Jestem doktorantem ze statystyki w Instytucie Matematyki UWr, freelancer.

How can we understand what is going on inside a neural network? And, perhaps most important, how can we design systems that serve people best? We'll show a series of examples from the People+AI Research (PAIR) initiative at Google--ranging from data visualizations for researchers, to tools for medical practitioners, to guidelines for designers--that illustrate how thinking carefully about data can lead to better tools, more effective design, and help humans and AI work together.<\/p> <p>** Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg are pioneers in data visualization and analytics. Their research has helped shape the field, and the systems they've built are used daily by millions of people. Fernanda and Martin are co-leaders of Google's PAIR (People + AI Research) initiative, which focuses on making AI technology broadly accessible and reflective of human values. Their prior work at Google has appeared on the Google search page, on YouTube, and in mission-critical internal data analytics tools.<\/p> <p>Before joining Google, at IBM Research, the two created the ground-breaking public visualization platform Many Eyes, which introduced visualization to millions of users worldwide. Viégas and Wattenberg are also known for visualization-based artwork, which has been exhibited in venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, London Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art.<\/p> <p>More about rstudio::conf 2020<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>rstudio::conf, the conference for all things R and RStudio, will take place January 29 and 30, 2020 in San Francisco, California.<\/p> <p>We're live streaming the keynotes so you don't need to go all the way to San Fran. 💪<\/p> <p>Link to conference website: <a href=\"https://rstudio.com/conference/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.com/conference/<\/a><\/p> ",

Firstly, I will give you an overview about statistical modelling in non-life insurance pricing and its specialties. How can modern machine learning challenge the good old GLM world? What is the role of ML interpretability and explainability in this challenge? I will illustrate the ideas on a large real world motor claims data set.<br/>In the second part I’d like to share some thoughts on model-agnostic measures of interaction strength. How can they be used to efficiently measure overall interaction strength per input variable? How can shortcomings in current partial dependence related measures be mended?<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Michael Mayer is an enthusiastic statistician and R programmer working as non-life pricing actuary for “Die Mobiliar”, one of the most traditional and successful insurance companies in Switzerland.

Being able to precisely estimate the potential duration of one’s disability is key to assessing future costs. At PartnerRe, we complement traditional actuarial reserving methods with predictive modelling. Our models make best use of all available data and are highly bespoke to the groups insured. In this talk, we will present our approach going from data to survival models to R-packages used for payments projections.<\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>Felix Reisen (UPC Switzerland)<br/>*Data Science at UPC*<br/>The telecommunication industry offers lots of opportunities for data science applications. Large customer bases, long lasting customer relationships and the digital nature of the products are the foundation for rich data sets which can be used to analyze the business and optimize processes with statistical methods. The area of applications range from targeted marketing &amp; sales, to call center optimizations, or predictive maintenance of the network. We will give a brief intro to our fully automated R based modeling environment along with a presentation on how the Advanced Analytics team at upc uses predictive modeling and data analytics to support the business in various fields.<\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>David Granjon (Novartis)<br/>*shinyMobile: mobile ready shiny apps*<br/>Have you ever dreamt of a template allowing you to build native looking IOS/Android Shiny apps?

Most of these files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds.<br/>Without explicit and structured file management, project organization can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product.<br/>This unhappy result can be avoided by re-purposing tools and workflows from the software development world, namely, distributed version control.”<\/p> <p>GitHub nicely compliments RStudio Projects by creating an online repository for your local folders.<\/p> <p>In this meeting, Marcello Nesca will lead a workshop to achieve the following:<\/p> <p>* Making a GitHub profile<br/>* Connecting RStudio with GitHub<br/>* Creating repositories<br/>* Set up a R project with multiple users<br/>* Following people<\/p> <p>Please bring a laptop computer if you wish to do the hands-on exercises at this meeting.<\/p> <p>____________________________________________<\/p> <p>The Winnipeg R User Group is sponsored by The R Consortium<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.r-consortium.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.r-consortium.org<\/a><\/p> ",

For example, a longitudinal baseball study might track individual player characteristics (team affiliation, age, height, weight, etc.) and outcomes (batting average, stolen bases, runs, strikeouts, etc.) over multiple seasons, where the number of seasons could vary across players. Neural network frameworks such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) can flexibly accommodate this data structure while preserving and exploiting temporal relationships. In this presentation, we highlight the use of neural networks for longitudinal data analysis with tensorflow and keras in R.<\/p> <p>##########<br/>Bryan Lewis<br/>Survival analysis, Salesforce, Shiny, and Shinyproxy<br/>Part I<br/>A sales and marketing pipeline model tries to predict sales from a time series of observations associated with given accounts. The observations may have many features, importantly including labels of reasonably well-defined *stages* of the sales process. Salesfore conveniently exports such observations in easy to analyze form. Viewed through the right kind of lens, models like this look a bit like classical survival models. A friend of mine and I build some nice<br/>models along these lines. The first part of my talk briefly discusses such models.<\/p> <p>Part II<br/>In order to make the models easy to use, we designed a shiny app. In order to make the app available to our clients, at least in beta form, we deployed it with Shinyproxy (and also Docker and Nginx), a tool that makes deploying Shiny apps pretty easy to do. I'll discuss this delightful deployment process in this 2nd part.<\/p> <p>##########<br/>Max Kuhn<br/>I'll create that modeling package in 9 easy steps!<br/>Creating an R package can seem daunting. The {usethis} package has made this process much easier but, for modeling packages, the {hardhat} package can do even more. If you are new to R or experienced, {hardhat} can automatically create the interface code (i.e., formula, non-formula, ...) and populate S3 methods (such as predict) for you. I'll demonstrate this for a truly awful model in a live coding exercise.<\/p> ",

Then Latent Class Models may be what you need.<br/>Latent stands for the idea of being \"hidden\" and Latent Class Models are a ML technique which sits in the family of mixture models. In the last couple of decades it has found it's way in the health, behavioural and the social sciences. It is a robust, data efficient and stable modeling technique which has been a great help in gaining insight to all sorts of science related questions. In the business world it has been used by marketing quants to segmentise customers and predict customer behavior. In this talk, we will do an introduction to latent class models, what they are, where do they sit in the available sets of statistical learning tools and how and what ways they can be used. We will illustrate these ideas using the R package called poLCA and briefly point also to its extended sister package called depmixS4.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Lito Cruz, has both an academic and IT industry background.

Three principal use cases can be identified: consuming a data model, building in-memory or local data models without relying on relational databases, and preparing consistent relational data models for consumption by others. Based on these use cases, he outlines the features of this package and discusses future development. The presentation will be interactive with live coding and a script that attendees can run during or after the presentation. The package is available on GitHub at krlmlr.github.io/dm.<\/p> <p>About Kirill:<br/>Kirill works on the boundary between data and computer science with more than 20 years of software engineering experience. He enjoys working with and contributing to the R ecosystem since 2012. In 2018 he joined forces with Christoph Sax to found cynkra, a Zurich-based consultancy that helps businesses and government institutions better understand their valuable data and communicate the insights, with a focus on the R ecosystem.<\/p> <p>Pizza (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/pizzapoll\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/pizzapoll<\/a>) begins at 6:30, the talk starts at 7, then after we head to the local bar.<\/p> ",

The Ookla Data Science team hosts frequently used fact-finding tools and RMarkdown reports in a custom-built Shiny deployment. In the first half of the meetup, Ookla's Data Science team will discuss some of the challenges with building a limited feature version of Rstudio Connect then provide a functionality demo.<\/p> <p>Heather Nolis (Machine Learning Engineer at T-Mobile) and<br/>Jacqueline Nolis (Principal Data Scientist at Nolis, LLC):<br/>Making machine learning models is a core part of a data scientist’s job, but that work will only be well-received by executives if they can understand the models. The AI @ T-Mobile team has been lucky enough to get funding and people for our projects by convincing vice presidents to trust our work using fun, interactive Shiny demos with T-Mobile style and branding. In this talk we’ll cover our process of creating Shiny demos, the tools we use to make them look T-Mobile magenta, and the technology we use to quickly deploy them (spoiler, it involves Docker). We’ll also show off a few of the interactive demos we made with some audience participation.<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you at this sure to be fantastic meetup!<\/p> ",

While the common heatmap allows us to gain a global view of count data such as gene expression or metabolomic data, it can also be helpful to isolate select observations for visualization in individual plots. This talk will demonstrate automated plotting of gene expression data for each gene in a cellular pathway using a time course dataset. The data visualization package ggplot2 will be used and the function tryCatch() will be implemented to handle possible errors.<\/p> <p>- ***NEW*** All announcements and presentations will be livestreamed and recorded starting at 7:00 PM.

We have two great speakers for the first meetup of 2020:<\/p> <p>Cristina Chueca Del Cerro will be talking to us about Shiny in her talk “R Shiny: Explore and Showcase your research\". Cristina is a first year PhD student in the MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit looking at political polarization and radicalization online. She will introduce Shiny Apps: what they are; what they can be used for; and how to make a simple app. In addition, Cristina will show us a couple of apps she has built using different data sets as well as different Shiny app features. You can see the full code at: <a href=\"http://github.com/chuecadelc/\" class=\"linkified\">http://github.com/chuecadelc/<\/a> and follow her on Twitter @ChuecaCristina.<\/p> <p>Our second speaker is Jack Taylor who will present his work \"Automatic Item Matching for Science\". When designing scientific experiments, matching items by relevant variables between conditions is a good way to reduce noise and be more sure that an effect is truly due to whatever the experimenter varies. Examples include matching participants by variables like age and sex in randomised control trials, or matching image stimuli by variables like contrast and brightness. When the list of possible items is very large, matching items optimally can be very time-consuming. Thankfully, we have R!<\/p> <p>Come along to hear our two speakers. Afterwards we'll head to the Howlin' Wolf for post-meetup catchup!<\/p> <p>Please arrive between 1715 and 1730, there will be a rep at the main entrance where you sign in, and one on the top floor to let you in the Unit. Due to the security at the building we can't guarantee anyone arriving after 1730 will be able to gain access to the meetup, but if you're running late message Fiona Christie.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Happy New Year to everyone, and welcome to our first meeting of the year, at Coop Bank. Our host, Mart Kaska, has been using R to support anti-money laundering (AML) efforts at the bank. He will give us an overview of the role R plays in his work, and in his talk will discuss how he's worked to support conventional AML analysis with more quantitative insights. In the second talk I'm going to speak about how, and why, to write R applications with a RESTful web API using plumber and Docker.<\/p> <p>Program<br/>------------<\/p> <p>17:30 - Arrival and snacks<br/>18:00 - Introductory remarks by Mart Kaska, Coop Bank<br/>18:15 - Start of presentations (~20m each)<\/p> <p>First talk - Mart Kaska, Data Scientist at Coop Bank, \"How to catch bad guys with R?\"<\/p> <p>Conventional AML analysis relies on analysts' domain knowledge on what kinds of customer transactions are likely to indicate illegal behavior. Mart has been using R to prototype basic quantiative models of fraudulent activity, both in order to test whether it can help analysts prioritize high risk cases, and also to check whether model-based approaches can identify problematic cases conventional analysis misses. As is often the case when expert knowledge meets math, some challenges arise in bridging two very different approaches to AML.<\/p> <p>Second talk - Andreas Beger, Data Scientist at Predictive Heuristics, \"Writing R web APIs with plumber and Docker\"<\/p> <p>Two problems arise when moving from analysis that run on your own laptop to \"live\" functionality in a diverse team: how to allow non-R users to interface with R-based functionality, and second, how to make your code run on someone else's computer (or server). The plumber package provides a solution for the first problem by turning R code and functions into a web application with a RESTful API. Docker is a solution to the second problem by packaging all of this into a container that can be setup anywhere where Docker is installed, regardless of the underlying hardware.<\/p> <p>Third talk – Simon Wenkel, Machine Learning Engineer, “R – Python – Julia. Insights into old and new languages for data science and machine learning and implications for their use in (high performance) production environments”<\/p> <p>Using interpreted languages has many advantages for prototyping/exploratory work but certain disadvantages for production usage. To overcome some of these issues, we’ll<br/>- have a look at these languages and how there are implemented,<br/>- have a look under the hood of common data science/machine learning stacks in these 3 languages,<br/>- see how to speed them up without writing extensions in C/C++/Fortran,<br/>- have a look at things to consider when deploying them in production environments.<\/p> <p>Logistics<br/>-------------<\/p> <p>The meeting will take place at Coop Bank, Narva mnt 4. This is right next to the Hobujaama tram stops. In case you are driving, there are a small number of free parking spots next to the building. Once inside, tell the front desk person you came to the meetup, go past the turnstiles on the right and up to the 4th floor conference room.<\/p> <p>Snacks and refreshments will be available, and you can bring food if you'd like.<\/p> <p>Meeting GitHub repo<br/>---------------------------<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/r-tallinn/2020-01-coop-pank\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/r-tallinn/2020-01-coop-pank<\/a><\/p> ",

How can we understand what is going on inside a neural network? And, perhaps most important, how can we design systems that serve people best? We'll show a series of examples from the People+AI Research (PAIR) initiative at Google--ranging from data visualizations for researchers, to tools for medical practitioners, to guidelines for designers--that illustrate how thinking carefully about data can lead to better tools, more effective design, and help humans and AI work together.<\/p> <p>Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg are pioneers in data visualization and analytics. Their research has helped shape the field, and the systems they've built are used daily by millions of people. Fernanda and Martin are co-leaders of Google's PAIR (People + AI Research) initiative, which focuses on making AI technology broadly accessible and reflective of human values. Their prior work at Google has appeared on the Google search page, on YouTube, and in mission-critical internal data analytics tools.<\/p> <p>Before joining Google, at IBM Research, the two created the ground-breaking public visualization platform Many Eyes, which introduced visualization to millions of users worldwide. Viégas and Wattenberg are also known for visualization-based artwork, which has been exhibited in venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, London Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Thanks to trivago for hosting &amp; sponsoring this edition of the Düsseldorf R User Group Meetup.

One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps.<\/p> <p>To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color.<\/p> <p>\"Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space.\"—Scientific American<\/p> <p>\"A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted. It shows how map makers translate abstract data into eye-catching cartograms, as they are called. It combats cartographic illiteracy. It fights cartophobia. It may even teach you to find your way.

[The book] conveys an important message about how statistics of any kind can be manipulated. But it also communicates much of the challenge, aesthetic appeal, and sheer fun of maps. Even those who hated geography in grammar school might well find a new enthusiasm for the subject after reading Monmonier's lively and surprising book.\"—Wilson Library Bulletin<\/p> <p>\"A reading of this book will leave you much better defended against cheap atlases, shoddy journalism, unscrupulous advertisers, predatory special-interest groups, and others who may use or abuse maps at your expense.\"—John Van Pelt, Christian Science Monitor<\/p> <p>\"Monmonier meets his goal admirably. . . . [His] book should be put on every map user's 'must read' list. It is informative and readable . . . a big step forward in helping us to understand how maps can mislead their readers.\"—Jeffrey S.

In fact, well-conducted complex sampling gives data with important differences from other data sources, but ones whose impact on the analysis is limited. Modern survey analysis software is aimed at reducing the differences to a minimum, so analysts and domain experts can analyse complex surveys correctly in most straightforward cases. I will talk about how you can use the R survey package to do most of the analyses you already do, but with data from complex surveys. ​<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Thomas Lumley is originally from Australia, but worked in Seattle, at the University of Washington, for 12 years. He is currently Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Auckland, where he teaches statistics and data science. Thomas is the developer of the R survey package, and a member of R Core. He has taught workshops on R in 13 time zones.<\/p> ",

We hope to see you there!<br/>****<\/p> <p>Shiny is a great tool for R programmers and has a lot of functionality. This evening we have a fantastic treat to learn more about how Shiny has been used for industry.<\/p> <p>First we will have some speakers from Ookla talking about they use shiny for fact-finding missions.<\/p> <p>Next we have talks from Heather Nolis and Jacqueline Nolis. Heather Nolis is a Machine Learning Engineer at T-Mobile. Jacqueline Nolis is the Principal Data Scientist at Nolis, LLC. Jacqueline and Heather will discuss how they use, customize, and deploy shiny applications!<\/p> <p>Date:[masked]<br/>(No Longer -[masked]-- due to snow)<\/p> <p>Location: Ookla HQ, downtown Seattle<\/p> <p>Doors open: 5:30pm for social time<\/p> <p>The first presentation will start at 6:00PM. After the presentations there will be more social time!<\/p> <p>David Hall and Katie Jolly:<br/>Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive applications straight from R. The Ookla Data Science team hosts frequently used fact-finding tools and RMarkdown reports in a custom-built Shiny deployment. In the first half of the meetup, Ookla's Data Science team will discuss some of the challenges with building a limited feature version of Rstudio Connect then provide a functionality demo.<\/p> <p>Heather Nolis (Machine Learning Engineer at T-Mobile) and<br/>Jacqueline Nolis (Principal Data Scientist at Nolis, LLC):<br/>Making machine learning models is a core part of a data scientist’s job, but that work will only be well-received by executives if they can understand the models. The AI @ T-Mobile team has been lucky enough to get funding and people for our projects by convincing vice presidents to trust our work using fun, interactive Shiny demos with T-Mobile style and branding. In this talk we’ll cover our process of creating Shiny demos, the tools we use to make them look T-Mobile magenta, and the technology we use to quickly deploy them (spoiler, it involves Docker). We’ll also show off a few of the interactive demos we made with some audience participation.<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you at this sure to be fantastic meetup!<\/p> <p>Please email/message Ellis Hughes if you have ideas for future Meetups you would like to see or organize.<\/p> ",

C'est une méthode qui est basée sur deux algorithmes (SIMPLS ou NIPALS) qui peuvent être utilisés pour fournir les estimations des paramètres des modèles. La régression PLS est très efficace pour analyser les relations de cause à effet entre les variables réponses et les composantes.

For those sharing during this event please plan on sharing a couple of slides about your own R use case, whether it is for personal or academic/professional projects. We will plan on everyone presenting their slides, saving some time for questions at the end of each presentation.

Hence, there is often a conflict between accuracy and interpretability. We want the most accurate models but don’t want to sacrifice interpretability. In this talk, I discuss this conflict and some new methods in Machine Learning for interpreting ANY predictive model so you do not have to sacrifice predictive accuracy.

Website: www.dontyouremember.com<\/p> <p>Title: Getting better at R By Learning More Packages More Deeply<\/p> <p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Learning R means learning dozens of different packages and methods. CRAN has over 10,000 packages, and it's not always clear what's important to learn next. Once you decide what to learn, it's can be difficult to commit the important methods to memory so that you can use them easily over the next weeks or months. This talk walks you through strategies for deciding what to learn, and then committing them to memory with the spaced repetition algorithm. It gives an example of discovering what packages to learn via code analysis. Finally, it describes the development of the remembR package, which lets you study R directly in R.<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Emil Hvitfeldt (@Emil_Hvitfeldt), Research Programmer at USC and Co-organizer of @laeRusers<\/p> <p>Title: Hyper-parameter Tuning with Tune Package<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Many statistical and machine learning models have parameters that can directly be inferred from the data.

These sessions have been designed to be a gentle but informative introduction to those who are excited to learn about the R programming language.<\/p> <p>Session 1: \"Learning and using R as a beginner\" - Leyla Yaltiligil, Department of Mathematics, University of Essex<\/p> <p>This talk will be about my journey from pure mathematics into the foray of programming and using software within my degree, ‘recreationally’ and also learning new programming languages to practice for roles that interest me. I am a final year Undergraduate Maths student and I’m fairly new to programming but I have really enjoyed my optimisation and data analysis modules and would like to explore R more.<\/p> <p>Session 2: \"Making the switch: One psychologist's journey from SPSS/Excel to R with 'basic stuff' along the way\" - Dr. Vanessa Loaiza, Department of Psychology, University of Essex<\/p> <p>Session 3: \"Best of R\" - Alasdair Clarke, Department of Psychology, University of Essex<\/p> <p>Snacks and beverages provided courtesy of IADS: <a href=\"https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/institute-for-analytics-and-data-science\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.essex.ac.uk/centres-and-institutes/institute-for-analytics-and-data-science<\/a><\/p> ",

Sometimes, though, you want all your interactive components to synchronize their outputs to user inputs instead of all acting independently. That’s exactly what the crosstalk package does. Carl Howe, RStudio’s Director of Education, will show attendees how to use the crosstalk package on RStudio Cloud, and each of you can try it out for yourselves. When Carl demonstrated this package during his R Markdown and Interactive Dashboards workshop, many of the attendees said this one package was worth the entire price of the workshop; we think you’ll find it worth knowing about.<\/p> <p>Carl and Rachael Dempsey will also recap the highlights of rstudio::conf 2020 held in San Francisco on January 27-30, 2020, and they’ll provide links to the conference content so that you can download many of the materials yourselves.<\/p> <p>Location:<br/>WeWork One Beacon Street<\/p> <p>WeWork is a community of creators.

Record linkage is the body of knowledge about how to approach this situation in its thornier manifestations and naturally this body of knowledge has its own specialized algorithms and software tools.<\/p> <p>You can easily verify that the speaker has a very common first and last name, and hopefully this will give you a sense of why record linkage at scale is not a trivial exercise.<\/p> <p>I will give a Step 0 introduction to R's RecordLinkage library including technical and business perspectives on \"Who Cares?\", an overview of just what is the library, a walkthrough of the data intuition around some pre-packaged synthetic datasets, and an application of the library to some simple problems posed to the included data.<\/p> ",

Whereas R has been increasingly used by data science communities. Biotech-Pharma can take many advantages of R, such as data visualization to analyze and present clinical trial data for decision making and regulatory submission. However per guidance, computerized systems used in clinical research in a regulatory setting must be validated, and validating R is extremely challenging because of the nature of an open source environment. This presentation will discuss the validation requirements per regulatory guidance for both system setup and application development. In addition, we will share our experience of building validated and non-validated R distributions at BioMarin, which include 1) the infrastructure of the R platform, and 2) key components of R validation process: the package management process, and package validation framework. Our exploratory work suggests that with an appropriate system infrastructure and process setup, validating R in the Biotech-Pharma industry is achievable.<\/p> <p>###########<br/>Doug KelKhoff<br/>Building Trust in Open Source Scientific Software: Grassroots Software Validation for R<\/p> <p>Many regulated industries are at a turning point in their adoption of open source tools. To stay competitive, these companies must make use of open source tooling, which often have the first or most well adopted implementations of novel methods. Likewise, as the tooling around open source development has improved, the tools have followed, to the point that most recent graduates have roots in open source languages and prioritize publishing methods with open source implementations. This form of software development is quite new to many regulated industries, and the decades-long processes that govern software validation are being strained to accommodate the influx of community code.<\/p> <p>I'll discuss ongoing work to build shared, cross-industry tooling for R package validation, how open source tools can be reproducibly delivered for regulators, and how these two pieces combine to provide a cross-industry mechanism to deliver reproducible results with.<\/p> <p>############<br/>Dan Putler<br/># Understanding Opioid Prescribing Behavior in England<\/p> <p>I make use of both the R spdep and splm packages, coupled with the Alteryx analytics platform, to develop a spatial panel model to examine the drivers of prescribing behavior for opioid analgesics on the part of general practice physicians in England, relying on data from the Office of National Statistics for England and Wales, the National Health Service of England, and the commercial data provider MB-Research.<\/p> <p>The analysis reveals that socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of an area play a major role in opioid prescription rates among physicians, which are consistent with Case and Deaton's findings of \"deaths of despair\" in the US. However, strong spatial dependence patterns are also at play, which indicate that there are systematic differences in physicians' willingness to prescribe opioids across England. This suggests that the traditional public health approach of providing regional physician training could be useful in lowering opioid prescription rates and related opioid overdose deaths.<\/p> ",

Traditionally, their analysis involved specialised software (and even specialised hardware); one aim of survey research in recent decades has been to make survey analysis relatively boring, so that it can be done safely by people with domain expertise. I will talk about the R survey package, which just had its 16th birthday. The package allows for exploratory analysis and modelling, and supports research into more efficient estimation in two-phase samples.<\/p> <p>About Thomas:<br/>Thomas Lumley is originally from Australia, and was at the University of Washington in Seattle for 15 years. He is now Professor of Biostatistics at the University of Auckland. His research interests include study design in epidemiology, semiparametric theory, computing and graphics, and genomics.

In this talk, the new tune package will be introduced. Examples of the tidy interface to model tuning will be demonstrated.<\/p> <p>Max Kuhn is a software engineer at RStudio. He is currently working on improving R's modeling capabilities. He was a Senior Director of Nonclinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R&amp;D in Connecticut. He was applying models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 18 years. Max has a Ph.D. in Biostatistics.<\/p> <p>Max is the author of numerous R packages for techniques in machine learning and reproducible research and is an Associate Editor for the Journal of Statistical Software. He, and Kjell Johnson, wrote the book Applied Predictive Modeling, which won the Ziegel award from the American Statistical Association, which recognizes the best book reviewed in Technometrics in 2015.

There are many questions one might wish to ask of such a tree, concerning the depth/breadth of the whole tree, or calculations across parts of it.<\/p> <p>Working with the trees is made possible in R via the `data.tree` library, and visualization can be done with `ggraph` extensions to ggplot2. In this talk, we'll cover how to create a tree object (say, from a data frame), how to calculate some properties on each part of the tree, and how to visualize the result.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Manipulating and visualizing weather data<br/>### Juliette Maire (<a href=\"https://www.sruc.ac.uk/jmaire\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sruc.ac.uk/jmaire<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Large-scale weather dataset (historical or predictions) is usually a \"big\" multidimensional dataset that includes space, time components and various variables such as rain, temperature, wind speed. Weather dataset is often saved as NetCDF file. This talk is a quick introduction to how to simply handle such files, extract or manipulate data from it, and visualize the results in R.<\/p> ",

Social media has made charts, infographics, and diagrams ubiquitous―and easier to share than ever. We associate charts with science and reason; the flashy visuals are both appealing and persuasive. Pie charts, maps, bar and line graphs, and scatter plots (to name a few) can better inform us, revealing patterns and trends hidden behind the numbers we encounter in our lives. In short, good charts make us smarter―if we know how to read them.<\/p> <p>However, they can also lead us astray. Charts lie in a variety of ways―displaying incomplete or inaccurate data, suggesting misleading patterns, and concealing uncertainty―or are frequently misunderstood, such as the confusing cone of uncertainty maps shown on TV every hurricane season. To make matters worse, many of us are ill-equipped to interpret the visuals that politicians, journalists, advertisers, and even our employers present each day, enabling bad actors to easily manipulate them to promote their own agendas.<\/p> <p>In How Charts Lie, data visualization expert Alberto Cairo teaches us to not only spot the lies in deceptive visuals, but also to take advantage of good ones to understand complex stories. Public conversations are increasingly propelled by numbers, and to make sense of them we must be able to decode and use visual information. By examining contemporary examples ranging from election-result infographics to global GDP maps and box-office record charts, How Charts Lie demystifies an essential new literacy, one that will make us better equipped to navigate our data-driven world.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>At this meetup we have an interesting presentation and training from Winston Saunders on data that is too large to fit into memory! We look forward to having you!<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>In 2019 the Washington Post successfully pursued a FOIA request for records of opiod shipments from the DEA's Automated Reporting System (ARCOS) spanning the height of the prescription opiod epidemic from 2006 to 2012. These data were subsequently published for 179 Million drug transactions ranging from mg to kilograms in size. While R's powerful analytical and visualization capabilities are, in principle, great for understanding the structure of the distribution network that enabled the epidemic, given the 78GB size of the dataset, efficient analysis required developing techniques, including data parsing and preparation of \"summary\" data sets, to dig deeply and thoroughly into the data. I'll share some of the techniques used to wrangle the raw data into more digestible summaries as well as the tools developed and the summaries themselves. We'll also explore how these summary data sets, coupled with mapping (ggmap), network analysis (network, igraph), and Shiny, can be used to reveal the magnitude the opiod epidemic and the network architecture, from manufacturer, to distributor, to consumer, that enabled it. To wrap up, we'll access one of the summary datasets and walk through a quick network visualization or mapping hands-on exercise. [To do the ggmaps mapping exercise you'll need your own API key from google]<\/p> <p>Biography:<br/>Winston is a data hackster with a day job. Though he first learned R in the Johns Hopkins Coursera pre-tidyverse he now enthusiastically embraces %&gt;% and, nine times in ten, chooses slice(1:10) over [1:10, ]. He’s explored ML, NLP, AI, image processing, web &amp; twitter bots, kaggle competitions, and lots of other applications in R. He selected his current project out of a balanced sense of responsibility and mischief.<\/p> <p>If you are wanting to have your own meetup to discuss the cool ways you are using R, reach out to Ellis Hughes via Meetup.com!<\/p> ",

Shiny is a powerful R package that allows you to create interactive applications ranging from infographics and maps to business dashboards. This workshop will start by providing a walkthrough of the basic framework of Shiny applications, including the creation of interactive plots and tables. This will be followed by some tips on how to kick your apps up a notch using only one or two lines of code thanks to libraries such as shinyWidgets, shinydashboard, and plotly. Resources will be provided for those interested in creating more advanced dashboards or making their Shiny creations available online.<\/p> ",

Jessica will be talking about the timetrackR app. Margie will be discussing the gtsummary package.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30-6:55 pm Introductions and Social Time<br/>6:55-7 pm R-Ladies New York Announcements<br/>7-7:10 Sponsor Message from IBM Developer New York<br/>7:10-7:40 It's Time to Shine with timetrackR App, Jessica Lavery<br/>7:40-8:10 Creating publication-ready and reproducible analytical tables with gtsummary, Margie Hannum<br/>8:10-8:30 Networking<\/p> <p>Title: It’s Time to Shine with the timetrackR App<br/>Presenter: Jessica Lavery<\/p> <p>Abstract: While tracking time may seem like a mundane task that in and of itself consumes your time, if monitored and assessed regularly it can be useful to create a record of your work and to identify potential areas for improving efficiency. The timetrackR Shiny app provides a high-level summary of active, inactive and upcoming projects, as well as visualizations for the percentage of time spent by project or project investigator, number of hours spent on each project, and a timeline framing each project’s trajectory from planning through analysis and manuscript preparation. With the option to filter by year, investigator and analyst, the app is versatile enough to use for an individual or for an entire team as well as for use on a regular basis and for year-end or longer-term reviews of how time was spent. I will highlight the key features of the app and demonstrate how to integrate into your current workflow.<\/p> <p>Bio: Jessica Lavery is a Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. She has an MS in Biostatistics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2014) and as of Fall 2019 is also pursuing a doctorate in public health (DrPH) in Biostatistics at Columbia University. Her research focuses primarily on retrospective analyses using institutional and claims data sources. She also serves as the[masked] Volunteer Coordinator for the Caucus for Women in Statistics. Follow her on Twitter @jessicalavs<\/p> <p>Title: Creating publication-ready and reproducible analytical tables with gtsummary<br/>Presenter: Margie Hannum<\/p> <p>Abstract: A critical aspect of many data analysis projects is presenting tables of summary statistics and regression model results. However, summarizing results into publication-ready tables often requires a lot of extra code to customize (e.g. create reference line for categorical variables, format p-values a certain way, bold variable labels, merge multiple model results into one table, etc.). The {gtsummary} package provides an elegant and flexible way to make summary and analytic tables in R. Written as a companion to the {gt} package from RStudio, the {gtsummary} package summarizes data sets, regression models, and more, using sensible defaults with highly customizable capabilities. It also allows you to pull values straight from these tables for use in inline text so that every portion of your R markdown analysis report is reproducible. This talk will go over the functionality of the {gtsummary} package, and how you can use it to create beautifully formatted, ready-to-share summary and result tables in a single line of R code.<\/p> <p>Bio: Margie Hannum is a Biostatistician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. Her research collaborations largely involve using multi-modal genomic and single cell data to characterize cancer subpopulations. She contributes to the {gtsummary} package and uses it every day in her analysis pipelines. Twitter: @Margaret_Hannum<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>We are excited to invite you to our first event of 2020!<br/>During this event, Martine Jansen will give a workshop on R Markdown. R Markdown provides a way to integrate code and report content into high quality documents. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats. In this workshop we will create an R Markdown document, in which we use the tidyverse to read a csv and manipulate it. After adding some analyses and plots, we will write inline R code, so the text in the report changes depending on the data. We present the resulting analysis with one click in a nicely formatted Word document. After this workshop you will have the tools to start your own analysis projects with RStudio.<\/p> <p>Martine Jansen works for Fontys University of Applied Sciences as an institutional researcher. Another form of this workshop was presented at the EAIR forum 2019 in Leiden and at R-Ladies Amsterdam.<\/p> <p>**PLEASE NOTE THE CHANGED DATE**<\/p> <p>Date: Tuesday, February 18th, 2020<br/>Starting time: 6PM<br/>Location: Avans Hogeschool Den Bosch (walking distance from train station)<br/>Schedule to be announced<\/p> <p>As a local R-Ladies chapter, we want to host accessible workshops and create a community of R-enthusiasts where everyone can develop their R skills.
