    "description": "<p>Talk 1:<br/>Speaker: Jesse Sadler (@vivalosburros), Loyola Marymount University, Department of History<br/>website: jessesadler.com<br/>Title: vctrs: Creating custom vector classes with the vctrs package<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>The base R types of vectors enable the representation of an amazingly wide array of data types. There is so much you can do with R. However, there may be times when your data does not fit into one of the base types and/or you want to add metadata to vectors. vctrs is a developer-focused package that provides a clear path for creating your own S3-vector class, while ensuring that the class integrates into user expectations for how vectors work in R. This talk will discuss the why and how of using vctrs through the example of debkeepr, a package for integrating historical non-decimal currencies such as pounds, shillings, and pence into R.<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Sylvia Tran (www.linkedin.com/in/sylvia-s-tran/)<br/>Title: Python for R Users<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>The switch from Python to R or R to Python doesn’t always feel natural. In this talk, Sylvia will help draw some parallels and leave you with a high-level cheat sheet for how to do the following using pandas and scikit, learn without having to get into the low-level weeds of Python object types.<br/>a) light data cleaning / standardizing features<br/>b) train-test-split<br/>c) pipe your data into a model<br/>d) evaluate model performance<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>Timeline:<br/>6:30: Socializing<br/>7:00-8:00: Talks<br/>8:00: Socializing<\/p> <p>Address:<br/>Room 115/116<br/>USC<br/>2001 N.

Tools for building a CNN are R and TensorFlow. The implementation of CNN in R will be demonstrated.<\/p> <p>Luke will talk about using C++ in R. Are is a beautiful language but some operations can be slow. The RCpp package makes this an easy talk and can drastically improve the performance of your code.<\/p> <p>Come early, network, enjoy the food and talks.<\/p> <p># Schedule<br/>6:30 - 6:50 Networking<br/>6:50 - 7:00 Welcome &amp; general announcement<br/>7:00 - 7:30 Convolutional Neural Networks<br/>7:30 - 8:00 Speeding up R with Rcpp<br/>8:00 - Raffle<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Networking and Clean-up<\/p> <p># Talk 1<\/p> <p>## Title: Convolutional Neural Networks<br/>## Speaker: Ash Pahwa<br/>## Abstract<br/>A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks used primarily for analyzing visual imagery. CNNs are used for object recognition in an image. Autonomous cars use CNN technology to navigate smoothly on the roads. There are many biomedical applications where CNN is used for image analysis.<\/p> <p>The motivation for CNN originated from the Hubel &amp; Wiesel (Noble prize winners 1981) study of the human visual system. This research leads to the idea that if we apply the convolution operations to the image and then feed them to neural networks, the accuracy of object identification increases. This idea started the revolution of CNN.<\/p> <p>This talk will cover the architecture of CNN. The Convolution and Pooling operations will be covered. Tools for building a CNN are R and TensorFlow. The implementation of CNN in R will be demonstrated.<\/p> <p># Talk 2<\/p> <p>## Title: Speeding up R with Rcpp<br/>## Speaker: Luke Klein<br/>## Abstract<br/>R is a beautiful and flexible language, and it is improving all the time. However, some processes (e.g. repeated function calls) can add a lot of computational overhead. Rcpp is a package for extending R with C++ functions which is utilized by over 1000 packages on CRAN. Many R data types and objects can be mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both writing new code for people just learning C++, as well as easier integration of third-party libraries. In this talk, I'll demonstrate how easy it is to get started with Rcpp and what kind of performance boosts one can achieve. If you're taking aim at levelling-up your function writing skills then Rcpp is the place to start.<\/p> <p># Sponsor<\/p> <p>Kforce is an international staffing firm specialized in the IT and Finance and Accounting space.

Often facing the need to group observations? This presentation is for you.<\/p> <p>Segmentation should be balanced and distinctive, the discovered over- and under-indexed features within segments should create a meaningful story, and, ideally, the amount of differentiative factors that drives segmentation should be small.<\/p> <p>The last requirement often becomes a bottleneck in a survey where respondents are asked an enormous amount of questions. One solution is the non-negative matrix factorization that, in one attempt, segments respondents and their features! The concept of the NMF decomposition and applications in R will be presented with the explanation of diagnostic plots.<\/p> <p>The 30-minute presentation will be followed by a 60-minute workshop, so bring your laptops!<\/p> <p>As usual, short contributions and announcements from the audience are always welcome. We want to be a diverse and inclusive group, please come, bring your friends.

    "description": "<p>September Boston UseR Group Event<br/>We will have two presentations at this event:<\/p> <p>+ Use Cases of R at Ahold Delhaize<br/>+ Using Reticulate in your Workflow (how to use both Python and R together)<\/p> <p>Abstract #1:<br/>In this presentation, we’ll discuss how the US data science team at Ahold Delhaize uses R. We’ll cover our development and deployment processes. Then we’ll show a coding example of one of our favorite libraries, BSTS (Bayesian structural time series). We rely on this package for forecasting and temporal causal inference modeling.<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Matt Phair is Ahold Delhaize’s US Manager of Data Science. This team develops algorithms to support the organization’s subsidiary companies with all things personalization and customer-facing. Whether recommendation engines, forecasting algorithms, or constrained optimization tools this team uses data science to improve customer experiences and optimize operations.<\/p> <p>Abstract #2:<br/>With the publication of the reticulate package, R users can now integrate Python into their workflow and Python users can take advantage of R Markdown and other R libraries. In this talk, we’ll explore some of the differences in presentation between Python code in Jupyter Notebook and R Markdown as we look at some time series data. Additionally, we’ll look at ways to work with combined code, using Python to import and handle data and then make some plots in ggplot.<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Bryan Butler is a Lead Data Scientist at the Hanover Insurance Group. His work is mainly focused on applying text analytics and natural language processing to predicting claims and underwriting risks. While having additional experience in both banking and marketing research, he spent most of his career in the insurance industry modeling the impacts of natural catastrophes (hurricanes, earthquakes and extra-tropical cyclones) as well as terrorist attacks, and stress testing capital models.

Containers allow software to be used in a reproducible, reliable and isolated fashion.<\/p> <p>Bioconductor also produces containers which replicate their build machines to allow developers contributing to the project to test their changes more aggressively before being put in production. These containers will provide the base infrastructure for cloud/web platforms in the near future.

    "description": "<p>For this event, we are delighted to have the visit of 2 organizers of the LA R Users Group -- Malcom and Zhi! It is a great opportunity to hear more about what they are working on and network among the SoCal R Users groups, including SB R-Ladies.<\/p> <p>Malcom is a Ph.D. student in Epidemiology at USC (@malco_barrett).<\/p> <p>Title: The YAML problem: Writing and working with YAML with ymlthis<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>R Markdown is an easy-to-learn tool for reproducible research. Many people, however, bump into problems using YAML, the language that specifies metadata for R Markdown documents. ymlthis makes it easy to write valid YAML by handling the syntax and documenting the majority of YAML fields in one place. ymlthis will help you write metadata for R Markdown, bookdown, blogdown, and more. Let the Shiny add-in create a new R Markdown file for you or work with YAML and R Markdown files directly. ymlthis finally gives you a workflow that is better than trying to find and paste the YAML from the last R Markdown document you used.<\/p> <p>Zhi is a Ph.D. student in biostatistics at USC.<\/p> <p>Title: How R Markdown family automates the last mile of analytics<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>What is \"the last mile\" of analytics? It's the final step that one needs to take to deliver the insights of data and communicate results with decision-makers. R has made it easy for us to wrangle data and build models. With the power of the R Markdown family packages, your analysis can be easily turned into high-quality reproducible documents including reports, presentations, posters, webpages, and dashboards. It requires less time and efforts to create and maintain code, data, output, text in one single document, which leaves you more time working on your code.<\/p> <p>Sell you all there!<\/p> <p>Julien<\/p> ",

This data, however, is not available in an aggregated and chronological format. Our aim was to develop a tool to observe these projects and regularly store their data.<br/>We set up a tool consisting of a front-end to register projects and analyze data, and a back-end with an intelligent background crawling service.<br/>The user interface is powered by R Shiny, connected to a Postgres database and crawling is facilitated using an automated R daemon via a Splash server. The project is deployed with Docker and Shiny Proxy.<br/>The resulting tool enables an efficient collection and observation of relevant projects, automates parsing of target web sites to a high degree and builds up an aggregated and chronological database of newly available condominiums and rental flats.<\/p> ",

    "start": "2019-09-12",
    "description": "<p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Statisticians are typically not Software Engineers, nor are they taught good practices of software engineering. And yet, Statisticians often take the role of Software Engineers when they program functions in R.<\/p> <p>This talk covers major computer programming principles and good practices that help to make R functions intuitive to other R users and our future selves.<\/p> <p>As Statisticians try a function from any R package, they face two gaps: first, they try to figure out how to use the function; and second, they try to understand whether their actions with the function get them to their goal.<\/p> <p>The role of R programmers is to help Statisticians bridge these two gaps. For example, the second gap is small when the function provides informative feedback about its failure, execution or success. This feedback should be easy to interpret and should match the way the Statisticians think about the function.<\/p> <p>The takeaway of the talk is actionable principles which can be applied to the design of R functions.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<\/p> <p>Harel Lustiger is a Data Scientist at Harmonic Analytics Ltd. specialising in Machine Learning Architecture. His work includes building Machine Learning systems for New Zealand’s largest utility companies and public sector organisations. Harel started his career as an Electronics Engineer and after having a change of heart, moved into Statistics where he worked in Academic research for three years.

The beta-geometric/beta-Bernoulli (BG/BB) model captures both of the underlying behavioral processes (i.e., customers’ purchasing while “alive” and time until each customer permanently “dies”). The model is easy to implement using R's Open Source Library BTYD which was created and is maintained by Daniel McCarthy. For more information see Fader et al.

Modelling the factors associated with the gaps occurring gave insight into how the issue could be addressed.<\/p> <p>Sophie Shawdon - Senior Data Analyst at ClearScore<\/p> <p>Summary: Talk Data To Me: Using Machine Learning to Tell Customer Stories. As businesses become more number-driven, how do you ensure that the qualitative data - and in particular what your users are telling you - does not get left behind? In this talk, Sophie will talk through ClearScore's recent work on using machine learning to better understand its customers; and what we learned; and why there's so much value in 'dormant' data.<\/p> <p>Virginie Bonnefond - Data Scientist at Hummingbird Technologies<\/p> <p>Summary: The recent progress in deep learning is slowly but consistently shifting the paradigm that was followed in remote sensing data processing over the last decades. AI applications are starting to become available for a wide range of applications, from on-board data reduction to fine-grained analytics. Agriculture is one of the areas with the largest social impact of this technological revolution, through a two-pronged strategy. Firstly, AI technology is used to replace the typical flat-rate applications of chemicals with targeted applications only to regions of need, thus alleviating the environmental stress caused by intensive farming practices. Secondly, AI is used to substitute agronomic input across the season, something particularly meaningful in parts of the world where access to agronomical input is limited. In this talk, we are going to present in detail the related topics, while also discussing the technology bottlenecks, limitations and future directions.<\/p> <p>Michael Leznik - Head of Data Science at Product Madness<\/p> <p>Summary: Bayesian Decision making becoming the widely adopted methodology of choice in the industry. Ability to make your conclusions based on probability distributions instead of arbitrary binary p-values seems to be much preferable when it comes to decision making. The methodology allows to accept null values and estimate statistical power. Using non-parametric Bayesian helps to deal with non-standard models and avoid reduction of statistical power when the probability distribution isn’t normal. The latter is a major drawback when using regular t-tests. Non-binary; significant vs non-significant conclusions provide decision-makers with a plethora of outcome and wide field of possibilities.<\/p> ",

And thanks to those who have volunteered to speak!<\/p> <p>One of the things I have heard many of you say is that you are interested in hearing about what others in the Springfield area are doing with data. This is something I am affectionately calling, “Who’s Who in Data Springfield”, something I hope we can repeat regularly, in addition to the other types of things we do together.<\/p> <p>To kick this series off I have invited Sherry Woosley and Matt Venaas, from Skyfactor, a Macmillan learning company subsidiary, out to discuss what they are doing with data at Skyfactor. Skyfactor provides market-leading assessments and benchmarking that empower programs across colleges and universities to identify areas of improvement for maximum impact on student outcomes. Learning about learning, with data – fascinating.<\/p> <p>After that, we will take the remaining time to come to some concrete decisions on a plan for how to use this group to learn the tools &amp; methods of data science, and a plan for how we will work together with data to make Springfield a better place. Two other very important things I know you want from DSAD.<\/p> <p>Details:<br/>We’ll be meeting at The eFactory (405 N. Jefferson Ave.) on Tuesday, September 17th from 5:30p to 7:00p. Food and drink will be provided while everyone settles in.<\/p> <p>RSVP on meetup.com now so you get updates on the meeting room location &amp; any other last-minute details. As we get our wheels turning faster, we will post future events several months advance– for now, please bear with our dust as we try to get out ahead of you. We plan on meeting the third Tuesday of every month - it may help to go ahead and hold your calendar now.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>5:30-6:00 – Arrival, Food, Drinks, Networking<br/>6:00-6:30 –Who’s Who in Data Springfield - Macmillan/Skyfactor: Lessons from Surveys of College Students (Sherry Woosley &amp; Matt Venaas)<br/>6:30-7:00 -- Data Science After Dark Learning and Community Service Sub-Groups – What, How, When (Mike West)<\/p> <p>Macmillan/Skyfactor: Lessons from Surveys of College Students: After two decades, 500 national surveys, and 15 million survey responses from more than 1,100 colleges and universities, Skyfactor has learned a few things. Sherry and Matt will take a look at how data over the past ten years supports or contradicts common stories about college students and surveys.<\/p> <p>About Our Presenters:<br/>Sherry Woosley, Ph.D., is the Senior Director of Analytics and Research at Skyfactor, a Macmillan Learning Company. She drives the research and analytics for 50+ national program assessments as well as other student success-related products.

However, in practice the need for explainability goes far beyond this legal and ethical “right to an explanation”. Markus will summarise some of the reasons (including the less commonly discussed and less intuitive ones) and give real life examples.<\/p> <p>What an explanation is: this seemingly simple question is crucial but doesn’t have a precise answer. Markus will show what types of explanations are currently possible and in which cases they are or are not helpful.<\/p> <p>How explainability can be achieved: Markus will summarise the state of the art for explaining predictions, together with their advantages and disadvantages.<\/p> <p>The two most popular ways of explaining predictions of arbitrary black box models, LIME and SHAP. Markus will explain both these methods in detail and show how they work in practical examples.<\/p> <p>No AI/coding experience necessary for this talk, however it will be beneficial for data scientists who want to use explainability methods.<\/p> <p>Event Timings:<\/p> <p>18:00 Event opens<\/p> <p>18:30 Talk starts<\/p> <p>19:30 Networking, beer and pizza<\/p> <p>20:30 Event close<\/p> <p>The Faculty Research Lab, in collaboration with top universities, explores the frontier of AI through the publication of research papers and the development of novel technology.

    "description": "<p>This is not the regular breakfast meetup…<\/p> <p>This is a new stream where Data Practitioners can come together, share prepared material on a topic of the group’s choosing, and provide constructive feedback to each other.<\/p> <p>We welcome novices, but would ask that everybody reads about the topic in advance, so that they can contribute to the discussion.<\/p> <p>We thank the Iconic for sponsoring this session’s breakfast.<\/p> <p>Topic for today’s session: Modelling Time Series Data<\/p> <p>Required Prep:<br/>As our focus always leans towards data science applications, please come prepared with examples of how you have used Time Series data in your machine learning projects, and what benefits or issues you have encountered.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>7:30 am - breakfast and networking.<br/>7:55 - Intro to Hands on Data Science Format, and today’s topic (Geoff Pidcock).<br/>8:00 - Speaker (Kale Temple) - Modern Time Series Methods<br/>8:25 - Evaluator (Aidan Morrison) - Feedback for presentation<br/>8:30 - Lightning Talks - Your case studies, and group discussion.<br/>8:55 am - selection of topic/roles for next session, and close (everybody).<\/p> <p>Topic Abstract:<br/>Time Series data are everywhere, and more often than not, your stakeholders will be asking you to forecast something! So how can you model time series with more confidence than sticking your thumb in the air? Come along, share your experience, and pick up an idea for the inevitable next project.<\/p> <p>Talk Abstract:<br/>Kale Temple, Co-founder &amp; Practice Director, Intellify<br/>Time-series, as a field of study, has largely focused on statistical methods that work well under strict assumptions. Specifically, when there is sufficient history, there is little meta-data and a well-formed auto-correlation structure. However, as an applied practitioner Kale knew that most real-world time series problems violated these assumptions. This left Kale with an opportunity to use more modern time series methods, based on machine learning, to overcome these deficiencies.<br/>This session is designed to briefly speak about the unique properties of time-series, how statistical methods work and how and why machine learning (and deep learning) methods can be used to improve accuracy.<\/p> ",

Please join us as Rinu Fasehun, Senior Data Scientist at USAA, gives a talk on “Why Data Science cannot ignore Statistics”.<\/p> <p>Statistics is the science of data and statistical methods are a key part of data science, yet a lot of data scientists’ misconceptions regarding statistics involve coding algorithms without learning the prerequisites. With the rise of big data, citizen data scientists, and tools allowing for easy implementation of powerful machine learning algorithms, it’s worth asking if statistical concerns are being overlooked. Using examples, I will discuss how statistics and statistical methods play a key role in data science. I will illustrate the most common types of statistical mistakes in the data science process that people in the field tend to make.<\/p> <p> Bias/ Sampling<br/> Exploratory data analysis<br/> Feature engineering<br/> Simpson’s Paradox<br/> Coding algorithms without knowing what goes on under the hood<\/p> <p>Prior to joining USAA as a senior data scientist, Rinu worked as an Analytic Consultant in the Life and Health Services industry where she was responsible for developing statistical models for health outcomes, call center optimization techniques and disease management program evaluations.<br/>Rinu holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Statistics and a Masters of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Lagos, Nigeria and a Masters degree in Statistics from Columbia University New York.<\/p> <p>This event will also be YouTube streamed at: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1G0D2WBnVaw\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/1G0D2WBnVaw<\/a><\/p> ",

Machine learning models comparison (David Masip):<\/p> <p>The scope of this talk is to introduce techniques for the comparison of machine learning models. The motivation is that, when building a machine learning model, we try different features, models and parameters, and we want a rigorous way to assess which is the best choice. We will review both frequentist and Bayesian methods and we'll see their pros and cons.<\/p> ",

Instead, we'll sit with every attendee for a few minutes each and go over their Technology Stack knowledge question. Our reference will be the Kaggle Learn center. We'll be there for your questions over the extension of the session to answer questions you might have. Some topics are Intro to SQL, Intro to Machine Learning and Machine Learning Explainability A complete list is provided to the RSVP list.<\/p> <p>First Timers &amp; Intermediate Levels:<br/>You are encouraged to sign up on Kaggle before you come. During the 2nd part of the session, you will be working on a topic on Kaggle Learn or simply you can ask you questions. Everyone will get an opportunity to introduce what they are working on with the rest of the group. After the first section, invitations are sent out and introductions are made to the members who share the same competition interest. We'll provide guidance and ideas during the session for learning and practicing different Technology Stack topics (AWS, Winning on Kaggle competitions, etc.).<\/p> <p>This is a team-based experience. So, teamwork and communication skills are very important. We support professional and stimulating environment for everyone who is joining us.<\/p> <p>FAQs<\/p> <p>Is this event just Virtual (Remote) or is it both Virtual and On-site?<\/p> <p>Both, we'll use Zoom App and Youtube Channel link.

Dr. Lee is contributing to a meeting this month speaking about nonlinear models using R.<\/p> <p>A nonlinear model is an important tool used to describe the complex nature of observations which are not adequately explained by a linear model in medical and biomedical engineering research. An introduction to the use of nonlinear models with R will be provided. In the first session (40 mins), we cover the following: 1. choosing good candidate nonlinear models, 2. estimating parameters (and choice of starting values), 3. checking model assumptions, and 4. summarizing results from the model. In the second session (30 mins), key R functions are introduced and outputs are visualized step-by-step using nlme package. Extension to data with repeated measurements will be discussed if time permits.<\/p> <p>This event is supported by the Centre for Health Informatics (<a href=\"https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/centres/centre-health-informatics\" class=\"linkified\">https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/centres/centre-health-informatics<\/a>).<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Three speakers are contributing to our meeting on September. The door is opening from 5:30 pm with pizza and soda for networking. A meeting starts from 6:00 pm. The following is a summary of three talks (due to the limit of words). A full abstract is noted on the page at \"<a href=\"https://imstatsbee.github.io/calgaryr/meetings1920.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://imstatsbee.github.io/calgaryr/meetings1920.html<\/a>\"<\/p> <p>1. Burning out of Time: Power-Plant Decommissions and Mine Cloures in the Appalachians, by Reinaldo Viccini<\/p> <p>He investigates the claim that power plant decommissions are causing closures and production declines in Appalachian mines. He tested the assumption that power plants buy local coal and argues that observed differences in power plant efficiencies. He then estimates the correlations between aggregate electricity generation and coal consumption from nearby power plants on the mine’s production (intensive margin) and probability of closure (extensive margin). Finally, he estimates the causal effect of a decommission within the 10 nearest plants to the mine using an event-study method.<\/p> <p>2. Using unsupervised machine learning to tag oil and gas pressure drop methods used in commercial flow simulators, by Pablo Adames<\/p> <p>Oil and gas engineers rely on flow simulators to design and troubleshoot pipelines, wells, and thus the facilities needed to achieve production and operation targets within the safety and economic constraints. Commercial software simulators offer a wide choice of calculation methods for the pressure drop and liquid holdup at every point of the system, these are usually referred to as flow correlations for historical reasons. The difference in the numerical results of the simulations can vary significantly as a function of the flow method selected, leaving everything else constant. In his study, Schlumberger’s PIPESIM was used to assess 35 different methods on a model built from field data in the public domain, a metric was defined to assess similarity using unsupervised method. The machine learning results were compared to the empirical knowledge, and consistent results were identified for this specific production scenario.<\/p> <p>3. Asset Failure Susceptibility Ranking, using LambdaMART, by Busayo Akinloye<\/p> <p>The electric distribution system is one of the most diverse systems in the electrical grid. It consists of both overhead and underground assets. Growing power quality and reliability expectations from regulatory authorities and customers demand minimal downtime of equipment. Metrics such as System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI), and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) are closely being monitored by electric utilities and form a major part of the business’ performance indices. These growing expectations, coupled with aging assets and budget constraints require innovative and cost-effective ways to realize actionable intelligence in order to optimize spending, while improving or maintaining the quality and reliability of the electric grid. Data analysis offers a unique solution that is reproducible across all asset infrastructure of an electric grid. It employs complex machine learning and statistical algorithms to extract actionable insights and learnings from historical data. These insights will help utilities better allocate both financial and human resources to the most failure susceptible assets, truly making data-driven decisions. I will discuss the development of an asset failure susceptibility ranking system on the Calgary area Underground Residential Distribution (URD) System. This system employs the supervised ranking system used by information retrieval systems. The framework of this ranking system can be applied to all distribution system assets (equipment), due to the reproducible nature of the statistical algorithms it employs.<\/p> <p>This event is supported by PIMS and Cenvous.<\/p> ",

A model for streaming data should be fast to compute and adaptive to the changing nature of the data. These two objectives are hard to achieve simultaneously. Conventional statistical methods often assume that all data have already been collected and stored in the computer memory. Existing models for streaming data, are mostly proposed by computer scientists and only address the computational challenge. Without knowing their theoretical properties, it is hard to predict when these methods will succeed.<br/>We develop computationally efficient models with theoretical guarantee, with more flexible nonparametric models, and investigate their theoretical properties using infill asymptotics. Computational properties of the models are shown using computer simulations and then applied to some real data examples to show their power for modelling real-world problems.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Rushani Wijesuriya – Multiple imputation in three-level data structures<\/p> <p>Multilevel data with three levels of hierarchy are common in health research studies. A common problem in such studies is the presence of missing data and often handled with multiple Imputation (MI). To our knowledge there are only two MI implementations that are specialized for imputing missing data in a three-level setting (one within R and the other in the stand-alone software Blimp) and a lack of sufficient guidance for practitioners regarding the settings for which each of these approaches is appropriate. We investigate the performance of alternative MI approaches for handling three-level incomplete data by means of a simulation study under a number of different scenarios. Based on a case study from the Childhood to Adolescence Transition Study (CATS), we compared a range of currently available multilevel MI methods designed for single-level and two-level data combined with ad hoc approaches, such as the use of dummy indicators (DI) for school clusters or a just another variable (JAV) approach to repeated measures, in terms of bias and precision.<\/p> <p>Talk 3: Ravindi Nanayakkara – Stochastic modelling and statistical analysis of cosmic microwave background data<\/p> <p>The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the radiation from the universe since 380,000 years from its birth. In 2009, the European Space Agency launched the mission Planck to study the CMB thoroughly. The aim of the mission was to verify the standard model of cosmology using a detailed resolution of observations and to find out fluctuations from the specified standard model of cosmology. The main statistical model used to describe the CMB data is isotropic Gaussian fields. A random field can be defined as a stochastic process; indexed by a spatial variable. The Rényi function plays a central role in multifractal analysis, since the multifractal formalism in the theory of random cascades can be understood in the sense of the Legendre transform of the Rényi function. For the Rényi function on the sphere, there are three models where the Rényi function is known explicitly. They are Log-Normal model, Log-Gamma model and Log-Negative-Inverted-Gamma model. Our research aims to check the Gaussianity of the CMB Radiation data collected from the Planck mission. We discuss the statistical properties of random fields on spheres using high frequency asymptotics for angular spectrum.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Research using R underpins a wide array of applied decision-making. Growing recognition of irreproducibility of results produced using R raises concerns about the credibility of research and the reliability of decisions they inform.<\/p> <p>Although there are many aspects to reproducible research, one major problem is the basic lack of computational reproducibility of published work – or the ability to rerun an analysis and reproduce the same results. There are many strategies for improving computational reproducibility, such as clear code structure, functional programming, and version control. Besides these tactics, however, we often find that analyses that reproduce on one machine or in one environment do not run in another, or do not run in the future. This problem is related to changing computing environments and software versions, and can be addressed using containerisation.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Saras will introduce containerisation and its implementation using an open-access R package. This introduction should be accessible to those who have never heard of or used containerisation before, as well as those who already actively use services such as Docker for containerisation.<\/p> <p>Saras Windecker is an ecologist and postdoctoral fellow with the Quantitative and Applied Ecology Group at the University of Melbourne.

With high spatial heterogeneity and biological complexity, resected tumor samples present a significant characterization challenge, particularly when samples are scarce. Multiplexing in a single, intact tissue sample is required to identify cell types, understand biological pathways, and map cellular interactions.<\/p> <p>The past decade has seen the introduction of multiplexed immunofluorescence to establish the spatial relationships between various immune cells in tumor biology, in context. Histopathologists not only need to detect these multiple cell populations identified by specific protein markers, but also need to determine how they interact spatially, through a complex array of signaling markers. From upstream discovery, down to translational and clinical implementation, this multiplexing in situ need translates into high single-digit, even double-digit numbers of protein markers, to be imaged on single biopsy sections. Addressing this need, especially acute in immuno-oncology, Ultivue provides significant benefits of shorter panel validation, whole slide imaging at higher throughput without requiring dedicated instrumentation.<\/p> <p>Ultivue has developed a fully optimized, automated staining protocol on the Leica BOND RX platform.

Here we are with a new event that will take place @Polimi Leonardo.<\/p> <p>“Generative Adversarial Networks for age transformation in images”<br/>GANs are models capable of generating data, such as realistically looking images. Madhu will start by introducing the theory behind GANs, then, inspired by the famous FaceApp, Madhu will show in a live coding session how to achieve similar results using GANs.<\/p> <p>Madhu Sanjeevi<br/>Madhu is a machine learning scientist and AI researcher, currently working at Logos 01. After working in Mumbai (India), he recently moved to Italy in Mantova and will be showing a live coding session.<\/p> <p>“ML for Autonomous Driving: Lane detection”<br/>Lane detection is a fundamental problem for self driving vehicles. Nicolò will discuss the challenges it poses and how Convolutional LSTMs can improve current models by exploiting spatiotemporal relations.<\/p> <p>Nicolò Lucchesi<br/>Nicolò is a student of the Artificial Intelligence master degree in Pisa. He is particularly interested in applying Machine Learning to NLP and Autonomous Driving systems. He'll be presenting an application of ML to the latter field for detection of road lanes from a video stream.<\/p> ",

    "group": "R-Ladies Belgrade",
    "start": "2019-09-11",
    "description": "<p>Drage R-Ladies, Došao je kraj sezone odmora i vreme je za nove akcije 💪<\/p> <p>Imaćemo čast i zadovoljstvo da novu sezonu započnemo izlaganjem Dr Gorana S. Milanovića, dugogodišnjim korisnikom R-a i Data Scientis-om ogromnog znanja i iskustva koje će nesebično podeliti sa nama.<\/p> <p>Ako niste videle R-u akciji u pravom smislu te reči, dodjite da se priključite Goranovom izlaganju i kasnijoj diskusiji.<\/p> <p>S nestrpljenjem očekujemo naše okupljanje 🤗<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>R u analitici semantičkog veba: slučaj Wikidata<\/p> <p>Tokom meetup-a ću predstaviti bazu znanja, semantički veb sistem Wikidata, koji pruža podršku za struktuirane podatke slobodnoj enciklopediji Wikipedia i drugim projektima Wikimedia fondacije. Pokazaću nekoliko načina za pristup podacima sa Wikidata iz programskog jezika R, uključujući i lako upotrebljiv paket {WikidataR}. Predstaviću nekoliko Big Data analitičkih sistema razvijenih u R koji kroz mašinsko učenje (topic models - LDA, t-SNE) i vizuelizacije podataka i rezultata (rBokeh, plotly, visNetwork, igraph, dygraphs, Shiny) omogućavaju praćenje semantičke strukture Wikidata. Trudiću se, ipak, da centralna nit mog izlaganja ne bude samo prezentacija različitih sistema i rešenja, već suočavanje sa praktičnim, realnim problemima u Big Data analizama, od kojih - daću primere - neke efikasnije rešavamo u R (sa dovoljno dobrom hardverskom podrškom, naravno) nego u specijalizovanim Big Data sistemima (poput Spark, koji koristim praktično samo u ETL fazama). Voleo bih da vam poklonim neke trikove u izračunavanju ogromnih kontingencijskih tabela i metrika u R koji vam mogu poslužiti za razvoj igračaka poput popularnih recommender systems. Konačno, ako mi vreme dopusti, osvrnuo bih se na tipično savremeno obrazovanje u R za Data Science i zašto smatram da na kraju dana bolje pliva onaj koji je prvo zaista postao R programer, a onda naučio {tidyverse} - koji veoma volim i koristim svakodnevno. Biće i Rmarkdown notebook za sve koji bi voleli da počnu da uče o pristupu Wikidata iz R. Na kraju, cilj mi je da vam pokažem koliko je svet koji nastanjujemo u Data Science izuzetno zabavan, interesantan i dubok, i zašto ne treba da odustanete od namere da se u njemu profesionalno nastanite!<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Dr Goran S. Milovanović je studirao matematiku, filozofiju, i psihologiju, na Univerzitetu u Beogradu i NYU (SAD), i stekao formalno obrazovanje u eksperimentalnoj i teorijskoj psihologiji u oblasti kognitivnih nauka. Programer je od 80-ih godina i 8-bitnih mašina sa 64K RAM memorije. Njegov put u Data Science započeo je proučavanjem probabilističkih modela ljudskih kognitivnih funkcija (kategorizacija i učenje koncepata, semantička memorija, kauzalna indukcija, odlučivanje u uslovima rizika i neizvesnosti) i modeliranjem podataka dobijenih bihejvioralnim eksperimenatima. Danas radi u programskim jezicima R i Python, uz podršku raznih drugih tehnologija i standarda (Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, SPARQL, SQL, XML, JSON i drugih). Programski jezik R je njegova pasija i specijalnost. Od 2017. radi kao Data Scientist za projekte Wikidata i Wiktionary sa Wikimedia Deutschland, gde koristi R u analizi nekih od najvećih i najsloženijih skupova otvorenih podataka danas uopšte dostupnih. Vlasnik je konsultantske firme DataKolektiv.<\/p> ",

    "group": "R-Ladies Melbourne",
    "start": "2019-09-18",
    "description": "<p>Hi Everyone! Here is the first of our two events in September!<\/p> <p>Our speaker will be Saras Windecker, who will tell us about reproducibility and containerisation in R.<\/p> <p>Research using R underpins a wide array of applied decision-making. Growing recognition of irreproducibility of results produced using R raises concerns about the credibility of research and the reliability of decisions they inform. Although there are many aspects to reproducible research, one major problem is the basic lack of computational reproducibility of published work – or the ability to rerun an analysis and reproduce the same results. There are many strategies for improving computational reproducibility, such as clear code structure, functional programming, and version control. Besides these tactics, however, we often find that analyses that reproduce on one machine or in one environment do not run in another, or do not run in the future. This problem is related to changing computing environments and software versions, and can be addressed using containerisation. In this talk, I will introduce containerisation and its implementation using an open-access R package. This introduction should be accessible to those who have never heard of or used containerisation before, as well as those who already actively use services such as Docker for containerisation.<\/p> <p>Saras Windecker is a Research Fellow in Ecological Modeling at the School of BioSciences, University of Melbourne. She is currently working on spatial risk modelling for Buruli ulcer in Victoria, and is more broadly interested in applied Bayesian hierarchical models, forecasting, and open science.<\/p> <p>Saras' talk will be hosted by our fantastic sponsor Zendesk. Pizza and drinks will be provided for the evening. Please arrive any time from 5:30pm for a 6pm start.<\/p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you all there!<\/p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne<\/p> ",

His 23-year consulting career has focused on the development and application of ecological and hydrological field assessments, GIS analyses, and appropriate statistical techniques for addressing questions of interest to water resource managers.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Dan will present a brief background on the environmental issue of impacts to wetlands and lakes caused by concentrated groundwater withdrawals in the Northern Tampa Bay Area as well as efforts to study the recovery of these natural features following cutbacks in pumping. He was challenged to develop an approach to best predict long-term median water levels and ecological conditions at 684 unmonitored sites (7,900 acres) located in the vicinity of groundwater wellfields. He selected a robust regression kriging (RK) interpolation approach using R to provide estimates of water level and ecological recovery at each un-monitored site. The RK approach considers both auxiliary explanatory variables as well as residual spatial auto-correlation. Other machine learning algorithms may be substituted for “regression” in the “regression kriging” framework, so Dan also will present results using random forest kriging. This hybrid of statistical and geo-statistical approaches may have applications in other problem domains where residuals show spatial auto-correlation.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>It's my pleasure to announce the 3rd London Datacouncil meetup, with a fantastic line-up of speakers!<\/p> <p>Steve Coppin-Smith, Head of Engineering at Snowplow Analytics will be discussing why your analytics strategy has to be a prime citizen of the delivery process - and what tools you can use to achieve this.<\/p> <p>Stephen Whitworth, Engineering Lead at Monzo will talk about how (and why?) to migrate a bank to dbt - and how the migration worked out for them.<\/p> <p>Alastair Turner from Pivotal will show us how the pgAudit extension can help provide detailed, specific logging for activity auditing, a key requirement in many environments.<\/p> <p>Special thanks to Snowplow Analytics for sponsoring this event (<a href=\"https://snowplowanalytics.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://snowplowanalytics.com/<\/a>).<\/p> <p>********************<br/>Event details:<\/p> <p>6:30pm – Doors open, networking, pizza and drinks<\/p> <p>7:00pm - Talks begin<\/p> <p>9.00pm - Networking and final beer<\/p> <p>********************<br/>Talk 1:<br/>Issue with tracking? Fail that build!<\/p> <p>Speaker: Steve Coppin-Smith, Head of Engineering at Snowplow Analytics<\/p> <p>Steve's focus is on supporting the Engineering team in making the most of their time and talent. Before venturing in to the world of data with Snowplow, he has spent time as an engineer and team lead on projects in travel, content, communities and education. Steve's key interest is in building high performing, self-managed, scalable engineering teams.<\/p> <p>Abstract: Your analytics strategy must be a primary citizen of the software delivery process in order to become a truly data driven business. Successfully collecting valid events is a largely solved problem, but were they a complete representation of the customer journey? Data and software delivery teams need to collaborate on the definition of this journey and better still assert that the product meets these requirements before being given to customers. At Snowplow, we've been building tools to help drive this process and bring teams together.<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Migrating a bank to dbt<\/p> <p>Speaker: Stephen Whitworth, Engineering Lead at Monzo<\/p> <p>Stephen is an Engineering Lead at Monzo, where he currently runs the Data Engineering team. Before Monzo, he co-founded and ran various machine learning and engineering teams at Ravelin. He lives in London, and is uncomfortable with referring to himself in the third person.<\/p> <p>Abstract: Monzo recently migrated their entire analytics function to run on dbt - a tool for managing transformation in data warehouses. In this talk, I'll go through why we chose dbt, the process of how we went about it, what went well, and some of the challenges we faced.<\/p> <p>Talk 3:<br/>Activity auditing with pgAudit<\/p> <p>Speaker: Alastair Turner, Data Engineering at Pivotal<\/p> <p>Alastair has been doing what his wife describes as “He's in computers” for very nearly 25 years. During this time he has coded around all things database from Access to Universe, exploring ways to capture, torture and display data - before going to the dark(er) side as a Sales Engineer. When this allows him the time, Alastair is an occasional contributor to a number of open-source projects.<\/p> <p>Abstract: Activity auditing is a key requirement for database technologies in many environments. While Postgres logging can log a lot of detail, parsing details out of logged query text can be painful and it's easy to get it wrong. Join Alastair Turner from Pivotal to learn how the pgAudit extension can help you to provide detailed, specific logging of the session and object activity that matters. With improved management of privilege escalation thrown in as a bonus.<\/p> <p>********************<br/>If you'd like to give a talk at one of our future events about data engineering, data science, or data products, we have an open sign up form:<br/><a href=\"https://davidchia.typeform.com/to/DMHEsm\" class=\"linkified\">https://davidchia.typeform.com/to/DMHEsm<\/a><br/>We'd love to hear your story!<\/p> ",

We use AI every day often without even realizing that we do. When you type in a phase on the Google search bar or talk to Alexa, you are interacting with an AI system.<\/p> <p>Today companies are trying to figure out how to use the power of AI in transformation - to reduce cost, speed things up, and provide amazing customer experiences. Questions that companies may ask themselves are, how do we start and which problems do we address?<br/>Not to be left behind, you as an individual or an employee will also have to transform yourself to meet the AI challenge. Questions you may ask yourself are, how will my job change, and how can I stay relevant?<br/>In this introductory talk, Raj will explore these two threads of company and personal transformation while introducing AI and its sub-disciplines in easy-to-understand terms. You’ll walk away with a simple framework of how to think about AI and get some of your questions on the topic answered.<\/p> <p>Brief Professional Bio:<br/>-----------------------------<br/>Dr. Raj Ramesh works with people and organizations that want to transform themselves for the future while leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence.<\/p> <p>Raj has a doctorate in AI and seeks to bring together the complementary strengths of machines and humans to ultimately transform how to incorporate AI in business.<\/p> <p>He is also the Chief AI Officer at DataFoundry, where he is spearheading the development of their AI platform and structure.<\/p> <p>Raj is also an accomplished writer publishing many articles on the topics of AI and architecture. In his recent book, “AI &amp; You: How to Think, Thrive, and Transform in an Artificial Intelligence Future,” he explores how individuals and companies can best prepare for the new changes AI will bring.<\/p> <p>Website &amp; Social Media Links:<br/>----------------------------------------<br/>www.topsigma.com<br/>www.linkedin.com/in/rajramesh<br/>www.youtube.com/rajramesh<\/p> ",

This will be a time to talk through practical applications of LMEMs for your own work and ask questions of Bodo and the more advanced users. This will be a great opportunity for people comfortable with statistics to ask more advanced methodological questions *as well as* for people who are more new to LMEMs and R to consolidate the tutorial material.<\/p> <p>Timings:<br/>18:00 - 19:00 LMEM Tutorial<br/>19:00 - 20:00 Question and Answers and Pizza<\/p> <p>We will be in the Urban Sciences Building again (2.022) and the room will be accessible through the main entrance to the building.<\/p> <p>Please arrive with R and R Studio installed on your laptop.

    "description": "<p>Statistics on Street Corners: Bridging the gap between inferential and exploratory analysis using crowd-sourcing with data visualisation<\/p> <p>Plots of data often provoke the response \"is what we see really there\". In this talk we will discuss ways to give visual statistical methods an inferential framework. Statistical significance of \"graphical discoveries\" is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of null datasets: plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests, in a process modeled after the \"lineup\", popular from criminal legal procedures. This is a simple but rigorous protocol that provides valid inference, yielding p-values for graphical findings. The procedure can also be used to objectively decide the best choice of graphical display of the same data, for communicating information.<\/p> <p>Biography<\/p> <p>Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. She is a world leader in data visualisation, especially the visualisation of high-dimensional data using tours with low-dimensional projections, and projection pursuit. She is currently focussing on bridging the gap between exploratory graphics and statistical inference. Di is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, was recently the editor of the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, and has been elected as an Ordinary Member of the R Foundation. Several of her students have won the prestigious American Statistical Association John Chambers Software Award, including Hadley Wickham, Yihui Xie, Carson Sievert, and most recently, Monash student Earo Wang.<\/p> ",

Review basic visualisation and inference with graphics: This part covers making plots using the grammar of graphics and how this fits into statistical inference. We will use the packages ggplot2 and nullabor.<\/p> <p>B. Plotting multiple dimensions in a single static plot, adding interaction: The building blocks to viewing high-dimensions are generalised pairs plots and parallel coordinate plots, available in the R package GGally. There are many variations and options that will be discussed, along with making these interactive with the plotly package.<\/p> <p>C. Using dynamic plots (tours) to examine models in the data space, beyond 3D: This part will cover the use of tours to examine multivariate spaces, in relation to dimension reduction techniques like principal component analysis and t-SNE, supervised and unsupervised classification models. We will also examine high-dimension, low-sample size problems. The tourr and spinifex packages will be used.<\/p> <p>The workshop is interactive, bring your laptop and work along with the instructor, and do challenge exercises.<\/p> <p>Materials are designed for an intermediate audience, users who are familiar with R, basic visualisation and tidyverse tools, and who would like to improve their knowledge about data visualisation.<\/p> <p>Biography<\/p> <p>Dianne Cook is Professor of Business Analytics at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

The #tidytuesday initiative was created by R for Data Science (#R4DS) - they release a data set every Tuesday with the challenge to create a unique visualisation based on the data set. We will be doing just that! Bring along your laptop - we will be downloading the #tidytuesday data set released that day (or you could use a previous one if you like) and using it to practice our visualisation skills. We will provide a short script to get you started. You are welcome to work on your own or collaborate, and bring your own data and questions along if you'd like. If you can, please bring something to drink and/or some snacks to share!<\/p> <p>From R4DS: \"Join the R4DS online learning community in the weekly #TidyTuesday event! Every week we post a raw dataset, a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask you to explore the data. While the dataset will be “tamed”, it will not always be tidy! As such you might need to apply various R for Data Science techniques to wrangle the data into a true tidy format. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply your R skills, get feedback, explore other’s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community! As such we encourage everyone of all skills to participate!”<\/p> <p>We encourage a mix of regular useRs and total beginners to encourage a collaborative co-learning space. Follow #tidytuesday on Twitter for some examples of visualisations created in the past. If you feel up to it, we encourage posting your own visualisation :)<\/p> ",

We then give an introduction to R Shiny, a package used to create interactive web apps, and show off our network visualisation and editing app. Finally, we will discuss how we can improve this ongoing project and future applications of our networking efforts in analysing the Scottish economy. We have used the `NetworkToolbox` library for the implementation of the main algorithm. The packages `dplyr` and `tidyr` were used for data manipulation, `plotly` and `igraph` are used for visualisations, and of course `Shiny` is used to build a convenient user interface.

What you build in the lab might not generalize to the field. The data you used in development isn’t accessible to your model in production. The fundamental shape of your ML model drivers changes over time, leading to predictive degradation. And as your model degrades, your stakeholders will ask you to determine why that’s happening, to give them a timeframe for upgrading your model release, and to specify your expectations for avoiding this outcome in the future. (Have fun with that!)<\/p> <p>The financial services industry is the domain where probability and risk were coined in the 1700s. (Sorry for the pun. Fully intentional.). In this industry, when data science practitioners make these mistakes, tens to hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake, consumers’ credit records can be affected, and heads roll. For these reasons, the financial services industry (and banking in particular) has put in place repeatable practices to measure model effectiveness and to validate all aspects of these models in ways that is transparent, auditable and explainable.<\/p> <p>In this deeply technical and practical discussion, you will learn the practices specific to the best-in-class model performance and validation practices used by financial services practitioners. These practices are completely transferable to virtually every other industry, and the majority (by volume) of actionable business problems, that draw on machine learning approaches. By better understanding how to measure the performance of your models, how to diagnose why they’re working well or poorly, and what you need to do to fix it, you will be able to more effectively set the expectations of your stakeholders, and save yourself a ton of headaches.<\/p> <p>Speaker’s Profile:<br/>Robin Way is the founder and President of the decision optimization specialist firm Corios and is a Faculty Member at the International Institute of Analytics. He has over 30 years of experience in the design, development, execution, and improvement of applied analytics models for clients in the banking, insurance and energy industries. Robin wrote the book Skate Where The Puck’s Headed: A Playbook for Scoring Big with Predictive Analytics. He lives in Portland, Oregon with his wife and two sons.

Notably, large and heterogeneous datasets need specific techniques also for the exploration, and I found that an effective combination of interactivity and reproducibility is essential for doing this properly.<\/p> <p>Interactive visualization can be a key player in this regard: for quality assessment of often noisy multivariate data, for hypothesis generation and exploration, for the visualization of results, as well as for the efficient communication of findings. Another essential aspect is that often the scientists generating the primary data might not be well versed in programming, notably increasing the iterations required to extract insight out of it.<\/p> <p>Many of these aspects are common in other fields than bioinformatics, and I will present in detail the functionality of a Bioconductor software I co-developed, iSEE (<a href=\"http://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/\" class=\"linkified\">http://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEE/<\/a>) as an application. Leveraging point-and-click user interfaces with guided tours, I will show how users can efficiently explore high-dimensional datasets, automatically retrieve the code for the generated output, and learn (by doing) how to generate compelling scientific figures.<\/p> <p>About Federico (<a href=\"https://federicomarini.github.io/\" class=\"linkified\">https://federicomarini.github.io/<\/a>, @FedeBioinfo):<br/>I am a Postdoctoral Virchow Fellow at the Center for Thrombosis and Hemostasis (CTH) and at the Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI) in Mainz, Germany, where I can sit at the interface with many other disciplines and focus on translational bioinformatics. My research interests involve the development of methods and software for interactive and reproducible research, bringing together the fields of bioinformatics, statistics, genomics, and biology.<br/>I love working in the R programming language, and with software from the Bioconductor project, where I also contributed some packages over the years (pcaExplorer, ideal, iSEE).<\/p> <p>18:45 Talk<\/p> <p>Markus Nu - Deploying Shiny Apps in an Enterprise Context - ShinyProxy as an open source alternative<\/p> <p>After building your R Shiny app, you most often want to show it to others.<br/>Although Shiny Server provides an easy way to get started, in an enterprise context you soon reach a point where you want your users to authenticate and your applications to scale.<br/>ShinyProxy is an open source alternative to Shiny Server Pro, which has built-in functionality for user authentication and authorization, tracking and most importantly no limits on concurrent usage!<br/>In this talk we will see an end-2-end deployment with ShinyProxy, from running ShinyProxy as a docker container on a single machine, setting up an InfluxDB user tracking endpoint up to deploying your R Shiny application via ShinyProxy.<\/p> <p>About Markus: Markus is working as a Data Scientist at OBI next trying to discover interesting and meaningful patterns in data. He is excited by all kinds of data, big or small, logs or surveys, images or text. Prior to joining OBI next, he worked as a research analyst in market research. He studied Political Science (B.A.) and Survey and Data Science (M.Sc.) at the Universities of Mannheim and Maryland.<\/p> <p>Pizzas and drinks will be provided.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>TEMA: REDUCING THE GENDER GAP<\/p> <p>We meet, take a coffee, we get to know ech other, mentor each other and this week we can talk about:<\/p> <p>WOMEN, OBSTACLES IN THE WORKFORCE:<br/>The challenge of getting and keeping women in tech and data science This challenge goes beyond educational exposure though. Recruitment and attrition seem to be other obstacles causing the numbers of women in the field to drop.<\/p> <p>The NCWIT report questions the common belief that the lack of gender diversity among qualified applicants is the top reason for the unbalanced ratio of men to women in the tech industry. According to a LinkedIn study, more women are hired as software engineers outside of technology, comparing the 20% hired in technology to the 32% hired in healthcare and 25% in banking.<\/p> <p>Gender diversity could be unbalanced based on the way a company recruits for a position. Many recruiting efforts rely on referrals to determine top candidates. However, according to the NCWIT report, a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that 64% of employees recommend candidates of the same gender as themselves. And in a 2015 study, Looksharp found women are three times less likely to seek tech internships than men. These internships are another common way to recruit for STEM related positions.<\/p> <p>Once women do break into the field, keeping them poses another problem.<\/p> <p>According to the NCWIT, women are two times more likely to quit their job than men in the high tech industry (41% to 17%). However, the primary reason for leaving is not due to family obligations, contrary to popular belief.<\/p> <p>In the same NCWIT report, it was found that 49% of the women who left their SET job remained in the industry. In fact, 22% of these women went on to create their own company.<\/p> <p>WHY ARE WOMEN LEAVING?<br/>A study by McKinsey and Lean-In asked similar questions of women in the workforce as a whole. They found that women are four times more likely than men to feel like they have fewer opportunities than men in the workplace.<\/p> <p>Looking at the computing and tech fields, 30% of women in SET positions felt isolated or stalled, according to the NCWIT report. The feeling stems from “having a limited number of important or special assignments that are highly valued by high-level managers,” and “not understanding the ‘unwritten rules’ or norms of [a] company or department,” which can be linked to a lack of mentorship and support. According to a Hewlett study from 2014, this type of dissatisfaction is found more in women ages 25 to 34 who are fresh in the field.<\/p> <p>During a roundtable discussion, Women in Data Science, the data scientist of Data-Mania, Lilian Pierson said, “Women need to understand what opportunities are available to them, what those opportunities involve, and what the quality of life looks like for someone in this role.”<\/p> <p>This can’t be achieved without proper support. Mentoring has had a large influence in closing the gender gap in tech and data science.<\/p> <p>In the Women In Data interviews, almost all of the interviewees mentioned a mentor that they relied on for encouragement to remain in the field, whether a supportive family member or a co-worker open to questions.<\/p> <p>Sarah Aerni, the data scientist at Pivotal, said in the roundtable discussion, “… One of the main challenges is that mentors are most effective when they can see themselves in those they are helping. I actually do not believe that this means women should only be mentored by women. Instead, I think it has to do with the path that you have taken, so mentors can recognize and help with challenges they faced themselves.”<\/p> <p>RESOURCES:<br/>Women in Machine Learning and Data Science (WiMLDS) – A community hosting events, conferences and workshops for women interested in machine learning and data science.

La normalisation des données semble appartenir majoritairement à l’étape de pré-traitements, ce qui est faux, puisqu’on peut la retrouver aussi dans des tâches haut niveau comme la détection d’anomalies, l’apprentissage automatique, l’apprentissage profond, les tests statistiques, etc. De plus, l’étape de pré-traitements est souvent vue comme contraignante et peu valorisante. Il n’en est rien, car en réalité, c’est ici que se joue une grande part de l’efficacité de toute la chaine de traitements. La valeur ajoutée du data scientist est rarement dans l’étape maSuperMethode.apply(), mais plus souvent dans la manière de présenter les données à cette méthode.<br/>Dans cet exposé, nous verrons dans un premier temps l’intérêt de la normalisation, puis les différentes manières de normaliser, et enfin les applications.<\/p> <p>Quentin Barthélemy<\/p> ",

Parameters allow the user to change certain aspects of their report without having to go back and make changes within the R Markdown document itself. This is very helpful when producing the same report but under different conditions/assumptions.<\/p> <p>Title: Become a Superlearner: Using sl3 to build ensemble learning models<\/p> <p>Abstract: Kat will discuss ensemble machine learning in R. Ensemble models combine multiple models to create a stronger overall prediction model. She will give an overview of ensemble learning methods and the packages available in R. She will then focus on understanding and using one algorithm for ensemble learning – stacking, or superlearning – through the R package sl3<\/p> <p>Bios: Elizabeth Mauer and Kat Hoffman are research biostatisticians in the Division of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at Weill Cornell Medicine. They engage in short-term and long-term bio-statistical consultations with investigators throughout different departments of New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.

From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.<\/p> <p>Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in Invisible Women†‹, diving into women’s lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, unforgettable exposé that will change the way you look at the world.\"<\/p> ",

Data provenance---the history of data and how it was computed---underlies reproducibility of and trust in data analyses. Our work focuses on collecting data provenance from R scripts and providing tools that use the provenance to increase the reproducibility of and trust in analyses done in R. Specifically, our ProvTools use data provenance to document the computing environment and inputs and outputs of a script's execution, support script debugging and exploration, and explain differences in behavior across repeated execution of the same script. Use of ProvTools can help both the original author and later users of a script reproduce and trust its results.<\/p> <p>Adam Fox (MassMutual): Effective Monitoring of Production Models<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data scientists can deliver significant value by automating or enhancing business processes using predictive models.

    "description": "<p>Talk 1:<br/>Speaker: Huiyu Deng, PhD candidate in Biostatistics, University of Southern California<br/>Title: A gentle Introduction Using R for Deep Learning<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Do you know that R can also develop and evaluate deep learning models using Keras, one of the most popular deep learning libraries in Python? In this presentation, I will introduce the steps to set up the platform to run Keras in R and give you an overview of the concepts of neural network (NN) and deep learning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN). In the end, we will analyze a dataset using the Keras package.<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Jo Hardin (@jo_hardin47), Professor, Pomona College<br/>Title: reticulate: running Python within RStudio<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>A quick google search can quickly bring up many arguments on both sides of the heated Python vs R debate. I don’t take sides in that conversation, but I do recognize the value of knowing both languages and the power of being able to use one language inside software designed for the other. Whatever computational environment is used to execute instructions to the computer, it can be illuminating to see different implementations of the same syntax producing the same results, or alternatively, implementation of different syntax producing the same result. In this talk, I discuss running Python in the RStudio environment. I provided a series of examples in R Markdown chunks (both Python chunks and R chunks). I include details for those working with Python in R for the first time.<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>Timeline:<br/>6:30: Socializing<br/>7:00-8:00: Talks<br/>8:00: Socializing<\/p> <p>Address:<br/>Room 115/116<br/>USC<br/>2001 N.

The goal is to make it easier to create the metadata needed by markdown, bookdown, blogdown and other frameworks used in R.<\/p> <p>R and Python are both popular languages in Data Science. There is no need to limit yourself to just one. Michael will show us how to incorporate python into your R workflow.<\/p> <p>Come early, network, enjoy the food and talks.<\/p> <p># Schedule<br/>6:30 - 6:50 Networking<br/>6:50 - 7:00 Welcome &amp; general announcement<br/>7:00 - 7:30 The YAML problem: Writing and working with YAML with ymlthis<br/>7:30 - 8:00 Snakes in the Studio: Adding Python to your R Workflow<br/>8:00 - Raffle<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Networking and Clean-up<\/p> <p># Talk 1<\/p> <p>## Title: The YAML problem: Writing and working with YAML with ymlthis<br/>## Speaker: Malcolm Barrett<br/>## Abstract<br/>R Markdown is an easy-to-learn tool for reproducible research. Many people, however, bump into problems using YAML, the language that specifies metadata for R Markdown documents. ymlthis makes it easy to write valid YAML by handling the syntax and documenting the majority of YAML fields in one place. ymlthis will help you write metadata for R Markdown, bookdown, blogdown, and more. Let the Shiny add-in create a new R Markdown file for you or work with YAML and R Markdown files directly. ymlthis finally gives you a workflow that is better than trying to find and paste the YAML from the last R Markdown document you used.<\/p> <p># Talk 2<\/p> <p>## Title: Snakes in the Studio: Adding Python to your R Workflow<br/>## Speaker: Michael Espero<br/>## Abstract<br/>R and Python are among the most widely used programming languages for analysts and data scientists. While it’s great to feel comfortable in one open-source statistical programming language, you may encounter peers who prefer another. This walk-through aims to share some of RStudio’s versatility as we touch on useful commonalities between data science workflows in R and Python with attention to simple approaches to loading, wrangling, visualizing, and modelling publicly available data.<\/p> ",

Association rules are statements that help to find patterns in seemingly unrelated data or a relational database (information repository). When we apply to a user purchasing a product, we will try to show five other products that the user is most likely to buy together with this product.<\/p> <p>*Madeleine Bonsma-Fisher* (and possibly some of her collaborators) will be talking about a graduate student-led participatory live-coding quantitative methods course in R.<\/p> <p>Doors will open at 6:00pm, with talks kicking off at 6:30. After the talks you're welcome to stick around for some networking, and by 8:00 we'll leave the room (but may head somewhere nearby to continue the conversation!).<\/p> <p>The event will be held at Insight Data Science, so please remember to thank them.<\/p> <p>By attending, you agree to abide by our code of conduct which can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a><\/p> ",

Cependant, la documentation semble prendre beaucoup de temps et, lorsqu'elle est incluse, elle est habituellement la dernière chose ajoutée à un projet. Pour un projet reproductible, les workflows peuvent être présentés dans un fichier Rmarkdown, combinant explications et analyses. Nous allons nous appuyer sur ce format Rmd pour s'assurer de la pérennité de nos travaux.<br/>Nous tenterons au passage de désacraliser la création de package. En continuant d'écrire notre code (presque) comme d'habitude mais en faisant les bons copier-coller au bon moment, on peut développer des analyses avec toute la documentation nécessaire sans (trop d')efforts. Le format package simplifie le partage, les tests, la maintenance et la présentation de son travail.<\/p> <p>Sébastien Rochette est formateur-consultant en R chez ThinkR.

As such, Shiny has always faced questions about whether it can or should be used “in production”. In this talk, we’ll explore what “production” even means, review some of the historical obstacles and objections to using Shiny for production purposes, and discuss practices and tools that can help your Shiny apps flourish.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Sean Lopp is a Product Manager at RStudio. Sean leads teams to create useful, enjoyable products. Before RStudio he was a data scientist and worked on alternative vehicle models at NREL, infant sleep dynamics, and originally studied mathematics. He lives outside Denver, CO and skis and bikes with his family.<\/p> <p>We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts.<\/p> <p>* Pizza will be provided by RStudio<br/>* Event location provided by WeWork<\/p> <p>WeWork is a global network of workspaces where companies grow together.

Most business analysts are constrained by Excel to simplistic data visualization. We will review several techniques in R to automate tasks and produce colorful, engaging insights from the data you already have in Excel or business databases. This talk will be approachable for beginners and interesting for advanced R users as well. The code demonstrated will be shared via GitHub, and the packages we will review included aws, comprehend (NLP), pdftools &amp; officer (text scraping), dplyr &amp; ggplot, visNetwork (directed graphs), mongolite (MongoDB in the cloud), and Shiny.<\/p> <p>Andy will start his presentation at about 6:00. We'll have meet-n-greet both before and after. You do not need to show up exactly at 5:30 nor stay until 8. Thanks to Innovation DuPage and Benedictine University for the free pizza and pop and free meeting space.<\/p> <p>About the Speaker: Andy Roy is a digital marketing consultant with 30+ years industry experience in companies such as Neustar, Wipro Digital, Experian, Razorfish and Microsoft.

Stefan Müller introduces quanteda, an R package for natural language processing tasks such as corpus management, tokenization, analysis, and visualisation (<a href=\"https://quanteda.io\" class=\"linkified\">https://quanteda.io<\/a>). By emphasizing consistent design, the package lowers the barriers to learning quantitative text analysis. In addition to introducing quanteda and the typical workflow, Stefan will outline challenges and future directions of text-as-data methods.<\/p> <p>***<\/p> <p>### useR!2019 Toulouse : ZRH-PARIS-BORDEAUX-TOULOUSE<br/># Matt Bannert, KOF Konjunkturforschungsstelle, ETH Zürich<br/>The 2019 edition of the biggest R show on the planet is in the books.<br/>About three months later, R enthusiasts from around the world returned from their trip to southern France, the community has somewhat digested the gathering. Discussions with other attendees, the posters, videos of the talks and reflection of the very own live experience have helped to disentangle highlights and process impressions.<br/>If you could not attend, this talk is a chance to catch a glimpse of the useR! experience. And even if you have been to Toulouse in July -- you might hear about a talk or two you could not attend.<br/>In any case: Be prepared to travel to Milano (eRum) or St. Louis (useR!) in 2020 as the talk will increase your fear of missing out!<\/p> <p>***<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Abstract: In this talk we will look at Neural Networks for object recognition in images (vgg16 and possibly inception). We will talk about how the network learns and how learning affects what the network is seeing, that is, What are the features that the network uses to \"understand\" that an object is present? This will further lead us to a discussion of gradient-based learning and how it affects the ability of the network to do what we train it to do. If we have time we will show how this leads to the possibility of \"fooling\" the algorithm into thinking it sees something that isn't present.<\/p> <p>Speaker: Joe Dumoulin, Chief Technology Innovation Officer at Verint Intelligent Self Service<\/p> <p>When and Where: October 5, 9.30 AM, Jepson 122 (School of Business Administration, Gonzaga University)<\/p> ",

A single round of computation can take several hours to complete, and routine updates to the code and data tend to invalidate hard-earned results. You can enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of such projects with the drake R package. drake resolves the dependency structure of your analysis pipeline, skips tasks that are already up to date, executes the rest with optional distributed computing, and organizes the output so you rarely have to think about data files.

The purpose of this event is to look back at the events we enjoyed last year, celebrate growth and diversity of our community and discuss the road ahead. We will have a few lightning talks (10-15 min) on diverse subjects and leave time for discussions and reflections on how UseR meetups helped you grow or learn in the last year.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure constant flow of fun and useful events, we need to have people organizing them and making sure speakers, venues and practicalities are taken care of in time for every new UseR meeting. We would like to elect Organizing Committee consisting of 5-6 members, who would take on responsibility to serve the community in the next 12 months. Here are some of the topics that Organizing Committee will assume responsibility for:<br/>1) Recruiting speakers for the events<br/>2) Arranging venues<br/>3) Applying for and arranging sponsor support for the group<br/>4) Keeping community informed through timely announcements and event marketing<br/>5) Maintaining relationship with partner organizations, such as R-Ladies, global UseR network, and other meetups in Oslo.<\/p> <p>Based on the experience from last year, these duties should not take more than 3-4 hours per month, but we want to avoid the situation where everyone assumes somebody else is taking care of a particular issue and in the end no one steps up to the responsibility.<\/p> <p>Acting as a Meetup Organizer goes beyond the line on the resume. It means meeting new people, expanding your network and talking to colleagues in senior positions in data community. You also make yourself known to the wider community of R users around the world, get inspired to pursue cool projects and interesting ideas and generally grow as an R programmer and a data professional.<\/p> <p>We are hereby inviting you to nominate yourself to a community service position at the Oslo UseR Organizing Committee! If you have been enjoying our meetups, now you have the chance to make sure others can enjoy them, too!<\/p> <p>Please, post your name and a couple of sentences describing your motivation for serving at the Oslo UseR Organizing Committee for the year 2019/2020 here:<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/messages/boards/thread/52386458/0/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/messages/boards/thread/52386458/0/<\/a><\/p> <p>Thank you very much for your dedication to spreading knowledge of R and your support for Oslo UseR community!<\/p> <p>On behalf of interim Organizer Committee,<\/p> <p>Dmytro<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Two separate topics for this meetup;<br/>Exploring Longitudinal data with the brolgar package<br/>Productionising models in AWS using SageMaker<\/p> <p>Thanks again to Servian for venue and catering!<\/p> <p>Rough agenda:<br/>5:45: Networking, food &amp; drinks<br/>6:15 First presentation<br/>7:00 Second presentation<br/>7:45 More networking<br/>8:30 Close<\/p> <p>First presentation: Making better spaghetti (plots): Exploring the individuals in longitudinal data with the brolgar package<\/p> <p>Longitudinal (panel) data provide the opportunity to examine temporal patterns of individuals, because measurements are collected on the same person at different, and often irregular, time points. The data is typically visualised using a \"spaghetti plot\", where a line plot is drawn for each individual. When overlaid in one plot, it can have the appearance of a bowl of spaghetti. With even a small number of subjects, these plots are too overloaded to be read easily. The interesting aspects of individual differences are lost in the noise.<\/p> <p>Longitudinal data is often modeled with a hierarchical linear model to capture the overall trends, and variation among individuals, while accounting for various levels of dependence. However, these models can be difficult to fit, and can miss unusual individual patterns. Better visual tools can help to diagnose longitudinal models, and better capture the individual experiences.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Nick will introduce the R package, **brolgar** (BRowse over Longitudinal data Graphically and Analytically in R), which provides tools to identify and summarise interesting individual patterns in longitudinal data.<\/p> <p>Dr. Nick Tierney completed his PhD in Statistics at QUT and is now a Lecturer at Monash University. Nick's research aims to improve data analysis workflow. This includes statistical modelling, calculating diagnostics, drawing inferences and making decisions. Crucial to this work is producing high quality software to accompany each research idea. His work so far has focussed on the importance of knowing your data ( in the R package, visdat ), and on creating principles and tools that make it easier to work with, explore, and model missing data (in the R package, naniar). Nick has also created an optimisation model that identifies and possibly relocates facilities to maximise their coverage on a population, in the R package maxcovr. Nick loves the R programming language and how it has transformed his world. He is a proud member of the rOpenSci community, a collective that works to make science open using R, and co-host a podcast with Dr. Saskia Freytag about everything #rstats named “Credibly Curious”.<\/p> <p>Second presentation: Building Scalable Production-Ready R model using AWS<\/p> <p>In this growing world of Machine Learning, we often roam around creating POCs (proof-of-concepts), but an important aspect that is often forgotten is how we bring models from POC and into production. The thing is, productionising your model and ensuring scalability is not as easy as a click of a button or minor code change. Even after you get your model into production, we must re-evaluate our model, perform A/B testing and redeploy our model. This is all part of the data science pipeline. All of these steps are time-consuming and require many configurational changes.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, Jeno will present how everyday data scientists can take the model they have built-in R, productionise it with the use of Docker and AWS SageMaker at ease. This will cover the training, deployment, A/B testing of the model you have built using R and some aspects of AWS and Docker.<\/p> <p>As a Consultant at Servian, Jeno has been helping various businesses build scalable data and cloud solutions in the areas of AI/ML, Data Warehousing, Data Migration, Serverless, and Containers. He holds a Master of Data Science degree from Monash University and is a lover for R. When he is not busy roaming around Medium on the latest tech and analysing and modeling in R, he competes in Hackathons and Datathons around Melbourne.<\/p> ",

This is roughly my motto of continuous improvement and I'd like to share with the MelbURN community, a collection of learnings that I have acquired over the past few years. Whether it is following the DRY principle, or vowing to never write a for loop again, or learning to prepare recipes and bake them in R, a lot of things I have learnt have made me feel a lot better about how problems are tackled. Unlike other talks where you might learn about a particular package or technique, this talk will introduce you to some of the ways in which you can think about and be better at writing R code.<\/p> <p>Kaushik Lakshman is a data scientist and a massive fan of R. He works at Betfair where he uses R to analyse the incredibly rich and extensive betting exchange data, to create data products and create business value using data science. Outside of work he loves to have a go at building sports prediction models with the hope that one day it will help him retire at the beach (but has so far been very unsuccessful)!<\/p> <p>Second presentation: Getting your colleagues started with R<\/p> <p>R is fantastic piece of software which is widely used in academia and commercial sector – if you are coming to this talk then you are likely already a fan. In this presentation Lyndon will draw on his experience of teaching R to hundreds of academics and business professionals (and thousands of students) to discuss tips, tricks, and things to consider when introducing and teaching your colleagues how to use R. This will include different approaches to teaching and supporting colleagues, some useful tools and resources, and the different needs and support that your colleagues may require.<\/p> <p>Dr Lyndon Walker is a former statistics lecturer who is now a part-time statistician for SACS Consulting - a psychometrics and organisational psychology company, founder of Veritate Data Science - an education and statistics training consultancy, and investor/advisor to Preventure - a workplace safety wearable tech startup. He has used R for 22 years.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Deep learning models have been used extensively to solve real-world problems in recent years. The performance of such models relies heavily on large amounts of labeled data for training. While the advances of data collection technology have enabled the acquisition of a massive volume of data, labeling the data remains an expensive and time-consuming task. Active learning techniques are being progressively adopted to accelerate the development of machine learning solutions by allowing the model to query the data they learn from.<\/p> <p>In this talk, we introduce a real-world problem, the recognition of parking signs, and present a framework that combines active learning techniques with a transfer learning approach and crowd-sourcing tools to create and train a machine learning solution to the problem.<\/p> <p>We discuss how such a framework contributes to building an accurate model in a cost-effective and fast way to solve the parking sign recognition problem in spite of the unevenness of the data associated with the fact that street-level images (such as parking signs) vary in shape, color, orientation and scale, and often appear on top of different types of background.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<\/p> <p>6:20 pm - 6:30 pm Arrival and socializing<br/>6:30 pm - 6:40 pm Opening words<br/>6:40 pm - 7:50 pm Humayun Irshad, \"An Active Learning Framework to Optimize Model Training\"<br/>7:50 pm - 8:00 pm Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>About Humayun Irshad:<\/p> <p>Humayun Irshad is currently the Lead Scientist of Machine Learning at Figure Eight, the essential human-in-the-loop AI platform for data science and machine learning teams. He has expertise in developing machine learning, more specifically deep learning frameworks for various applications like object detection, segmentation and classification in fields ranging from medical, retail, self-driving car, satellite, fashion, etc. Now a days, he is building Active Learning frameworks for selection of training data from labeled or unlabeled dataset to build model to avoid over-training and dealing corner cases. He has 3 years PostDoc experience at Harvard Medical School where he developed machine learning and deep learning frameworks for Computer Aided Diagnosis system including region of interest detection, nuclei and gland detection, segmentation and classification in 2D and 3D medical images. He got a PhD in Computer Science from University of Grenoble France.<\/p> <p>A computer scientist with expertise’s in machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, bio-medical image analysis and statistical methods. He likes to use his analytical mind not only when building complex models, but also as part of his leadership philosophy.

    "description": "<p>In the real world, training datasets are not as readily available as Kaggle would have you believe. In certain situations, they are extremely costly to obtain, while in others they are impossible. In this talk, I will describe two cases where we had to get creative to obtain training datasets. I want an argumentative environment where we can discuss our ideas.<\/p> <p>Record linkage is a classic problem in statistics and machine learning. There are two datasets, with several fields in common, but no unique identifiers as match keys. Due to a lack of ground truth training dataset, unsupervised learning techniques are usually employed. However, we embarked on an ambitious project to create a training dataset using unsupervised learning, and feed that to a machine learning model which then learned to make predictions of match or no match.<\/p> <p>In the second project, we had to extract handwritten information from checks. The hard part of the problem is recognizing fields like dates, signatures etc on a check. The costly way would be to have human raters mark each field with coordinates. However, we decided to create a fake training dataset where we automatically generated date fields (populated with handwritten dates) and used that to train a classifier that recognized real date fields on checks.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<\/p> <p>6:20 pm - 6:30 pm Arrival and socializing<br/>6:30 pm - 6:40 pm Opening words<br/>6:40 pm - 7:50 pm Ahmad Emad, \"Data Science Talk #1\"<br/>7:50 pm - 8:00 pm Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>About Ahmad Emad:<\/p> <p>Ahmad Emad is currently a Data Scientist at Google, where he applies experiment design and machine learning techniques to make Google Assistant more useful and user-friendly.

What would it mean in practice to apply data protection regulations to a model in this circumstance?<\/p> <p>In research connecting the development of statistical models and the regulatory frameworks that our work is done within, this month’s paper explores these questions and looks at what lessons we can draw from this exercise.<\/p> <p>The main body of the discussion will be around the paper below<\/p> <p>- Paper - Algorithms that remember: model inversion attacks and data protection law - Veale, Binns, Edwards (2018)<br/>- <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04644.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04644.pdf<\/a><\/p> <p>There is also a blog by one of the authors which summarises the issues<\/p> <p>- Blog - <a href=\"https://ai-auditingframework.blogspot.com/2019/09/privacy-attacks-on-ai-models.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://ai-auditingframework.blogspot.com/2019/09/privacy-attacks-on-ai-models.html<\/a><\/p> <p>Further materials (not necessary for the discussion, but go into more technical aspects of how these attacks might work)<\/p> <p>- Video on Membership Inference attacks - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDm1n2gceJY\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDm1n2gceJY<\/a><br/>- Paper on Model Inversion attack - <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfredrik/papers/fjr2015ccs.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfredrik/papers/fjr2015ccs.pdf<\/a><\/p> <p>—<\/p> <p>A note about the Journal Club format:<\/p> <p>1. The sessions usually start with a 5-10 minute introduction to the paper by the topic volunteer, followed by splitting into smaller groups to discuss the paper and other materials. We finish the session by coming together for about 15 minutes to discuss what we have learned as a group and ask questions around the room.<br/>2. There is no speaker at Journal Club. One of the community has volunteered their time to suggest the topic and start the session, but most of the discussion comes from within the groups.<br/>3. You will get more benefit from the session if you read the paper or other materials in advance. We try to provide (where we can find them) accompanying blog posts, relevant code and other summaries of the topic to serve as entry points.<br/>4. If you don't have time to do much preparation, please come anyway. You will probably have something to contribute, and even if you just end up following the other discussions, you can still learn a lot.<br/>5. It's OK just to read the blog post or watch the video :)<br/>6. We don't have spare copies of the paper during the session, so please print out your own if you want a hard copy for discussion. For digital copies, you are welcome to use your laptops/tablets/phones during the session.<\/p> ",

Throughout the talk Tom will point out problems of current fairness methods when applied to real-world problems and outline research efforts that are being conducted now.<\/p> <p>The Faculty Research Lab, in collaboration with top universities, explores the frontier of AI through the publication of research papers and the development of novel technology. We consider our research efforts in terms of two categories: improving the safety of machine learning algorithms (AI Safety) and advancing their capabilities (ML Research).<\/p> <p>This talk will cover:<\/p> <p>• Why fairness is important (hopefully we don't have to convince you too much…)<\/p> <p>• How to define fairness in the first place, and the trade-offs between different notions of fairness<\/p> <p>• How fairness can be achieved<\/p> <p>• What popular methods are out there at the moment?

    "description": "<p>Description:<\/p> <p>Computer Vision applications typically employ numerical analysis that is very similar to and in some cases borrows from Data Science topics - algorithms such as RANSAC for point detection in an image for instance. This discussion will cover the combination of computer vision, pattern recognition and data science into an image processing pipeline that is designed to help deter fraudulent account access. In particular this pipeline acts as a “weak classifier” among an ensemble of classifiers that are used to determine whether or not an image is valid or whether it is likely to be fraudulent.<\/p> <p>Presenter:<\/p> <p>Greg Storm<\/p> <p>Most recently Greg has been involved with a couple of different Kansas City startups where has helped them research new products, primarily using their data. Before that he had enjoyed a career working with large corporate transaction systems and databases.

Introduction / Networking<\/p> <p>3:00 P.M. - 3:50 P.M. Session 1<\/p> <p>Title: A Scalable Artificial Intelligence Data Pipeline for Accelerating Time to Insight<\/p> <p>Speaker: Dr. Sanhita Sarkar, Global Director, Analytics Software Development, Western Digital<\/p> <p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) requires processing power and adequate storage while executing various deep learning (DL) frameworks. The training and deployment stages of a DL system have different data and processing needs. On one hand, the large volumes of data during<br/>training demands systems with support for massive storage capacity, multiple data formats and protocols for processing dispersed data sets, and sharing of data and models across applications. On the other hand, AI deployment for delivering inference on incoming data requires fast access to the data to meet the demand for AI responsiveness for applications.<\/p> <p>The processing and storage needs vary for the different phases of an AI data pipeline comprising of data ingestion, model training and model serving. Disaggregation of GPUs, flash and object storage can enable the delivery of rapid response times and scaling requirements of an AI data pipeline, without compromising on data persistence, quality, durability and cost.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio: Sanhita Sarkar is a Global Director, Analytics Software Development at Western Digital, where she oversees software design and development of analytical features and solutions from edge to data center/cloud. She focuses on key vertical markets such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Defense and Intelligence, Media and Entertainment, and Genomics and Healthcare. Sanhita previously held leadership positions at Teradata, SGI, and Oracle.

    "description": "<p>🆂🅻🅾🆃 #1: Get to Know Firebase and its ML Kit - Rachel Saunders, Google<\/p> <p>Firebase enables app developers to build faster and easier with serverless products (like authentication and real-time databases). The Firebase platform can also help with app quality (like Crashlytics) and growing your app (like sliced audience feature distribution and messaging). Both prototype and production apps can take advantage of our toolkits for developing and growing your app. Come learn about how Firebase can help you with your hobby, startup, or even enterprise-level apps!<\/p> <p>We'll also take a bit of deep dive into ML Kit - Firebase's mobile SDK that offers you Google's machine learning in a powerful yet easy-to-use package. There's no need to have deep knowledge of neural networks or model optimization to get started. On the other hand, if you are an experienced ML developer, ML Kit provides convenient APIs that help you use your custom TensorFlow Lite models in your mobile apps.<\/p> <p>🆂🅻🅾🆃 #2: MLKit + Firebase Predictions - Aditya Gautam, Google<\/p> <p>ML Kit allows you to harness the power of machine learning in your apps without needing to be an expert. Leverage powerful, but simple-to-use on-device and cloud-based APIs for Vision and Natural Language Processing, or train and/or deploy your own models. Understand some big additions to ML Kit and how to use these to enable smarter, richer experiences to your users. In the second half, we would learn about how we can do smart segmentation of users using Firebase Predictions and target the selected groups of people for revenue optimization, user retention and other customization.<\/p> <p>🆂🅻🅾🆃 #3: BigQuery ML: Practical use cases using the built in machine learning algorithm in BigQuery - Marcus Stade<\/p> <p>Creating machine learning models directly in the Cloud Data Warehouse? Big Query, part of the Google Cloud Platform, offers a integrated solution called Big Query ML with the possibility to create machine learning models and make prediction based on data stored in the database. The build-in machine learning solution offers a wide variety of machine learning models types, e.g linear regression, logistic regression and k-means clustering. In this presentation we will create machine learning models and make predictions based on business data.<\/p> <p>Marcus has a track record as digital analytics consultant. Before joining the digital analytics community, he was working in the field of Web-Development and Online-Marketing. He organizes the Digital Analytics Meetup in Munich and Nuremberg and publishes articles covering Digital Analytics topics on magazines and his blog <a href=\"https://www.marcusstade.de\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.marcusstade.de<\/a>­.<\/p> <p>We are looking for speakers and sponsors!<\/p> <p>As always, we are super happy to have you with a lightning talk on your small or big successes, open source projects or just something amazing you would like to share.<\/p> <p>Do not miss out updates on twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hack_ai\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/hack_ai<\/a> and join Munich ML community on Slack channel <a href=\"https://ai-hack-inviter.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://ai-hack-inviter.herokuapp.com/<\/a><\/p> ",

    "group": "Citizen Data Scientists - Melbourne",
    "start": "2019-10-03",
    "description": "<p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>During the training and development cycle of a machine learning model, the interpretability of model outputs is essential to verify hypotheses and build trust with stakeholders. However, what methods exist to interpret models? And is the application of these methods limited to the model development process?<\/p> <p>Moreover, after deploying a machine learning model inference data can change relative to training data. This is one of the main reasons contributing to degraded model performance over time. But what causes this to occur? And how do you verify a model's robustness after deployment?<\/p> <p>This meetup will focus on the topic of data drift and model interpretability. It will aim to answer the questions above with a balance between theory and practice, and explore how Microsoft Azure can help tackle these issues.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<\/p> <p>Nicholas has worked in several technical roles spanning finance, government and technology. He is currently a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft specializing in Data and AI. His professional interests include everything related to technology, artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing.<\/p> ",

Doors will open at 5:30PM where members can enjoy pizza, soda, and networking. The first talk will begin at 6:00PM. Included below are brief summaries of the topics covered in this meetup. If you would like to read more about the speakers, view future events, or contact us please visit our site:<br/><a href=\"https://imstatsbee.github.io/calgaryr/meetings1920.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://imstatsbee.github.io/calgaryr/meetings1920.html<\/a><\/p> <p>Talk 1: Cybera’s tools and programs in support of data science in Alberta by David Chan<\/p> <p>An overview will be provided of the tools and projects Cybera - an Alberta based not-for-profit organization - makes available to folks interested in data science, including members of the CalgaryR group. Tools include our free general purpose Infrastructure as a Service environment, which also provides access to GPU resources. Recent results and plans to support K-12, entrepreneurs, and budding data scientists in Alberta through our Callysto and Data Science for Albertans projects will also be presented. Lastly, we seek input from CalgaryR members on a tool that the team has been working on, which strives to apply best practices from the software development world to data science projects through a structured framework. This will include a brief demo and overview of a roadmap of challenges we hope to address with the tool.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Practical Applications of Text Analysis / Natural Language Processing by Naoko Tomioka<\/p> <p>The field of text analysis is constantly evolving, and new tools and algorithms become available on a regular basis. Text analytic tools and packages range from low-level processing tools, such as tokenizer and entity extraction, to higher-level processing such as sentiment analysis and text classification. The applicability of each tool depends on the type of the data to be analysed and the intended use of the output. I will talk about several of my own projects in order to illustrate the process of selecting the best tools, and what text analysis looks like in a business context.<\/p> <p>Talk 3: Community Development - Calgary Artificial Intelligence Meetup by Drew Gilson<\/p> <p>Drew Gillson is a technologist, entrepreneur, and community leader. In addition to organizing the Calgary Artificial Intelligence Meetup, Drew works for Looker, a data analytics software company that is being acquired by Google. Drew has been an active member of the Calgary innovation ecosystem since the dark ages of 2001. He’ll share some highlights and learnings from his remarkable journey, in the hope that it will inspire you to also take the road less traveled.<\/p> <p>This event is supported by PIMS<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>¡Te invitamos a nuestro próximo meetup de lujo que co-organizamos con WiMLDS Buenos Aires!<\/p> <p>En esta ocasión nos visita Erin LeDell, co-fundadora de R-Ladies y fundadora WiMLDS. Erin nos dará una charla sobre Scalable Automatic Machine Learning con H2O (en inglés). ¿De qué se trata esto?<\/p> <p>* H2O es una plataforma distribuida de aprendizaje automático de código abierto diseñada para big data. Los algoritmos principales de aprendizaje automático de H2O se implementan en Java de alto rendimiento, sin embargo, las API con todas las funciones están disponibles en R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, y también a través de una interfaz web. Dado que las implementaciones de algoritmos de H2O se distribuyen, esto permite que el software escale a conjuntos de datos muy grandes -que superan la RAM en una sola máquina-. H2O actualmente presenta implementaciones distribuidas de modelos lineales generalizados, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, Stacked Ensembles (aka \"Super Learners\"), métodos de reducción de dimensionalidad (PCA, GLRM), clusterización (K-means), detección de anomalías, etc.<\/p> <p>* H2O AutoML proporciona una interfaz fácil de usar que automatiza el pre-procesamiento de datos, el entrenamiento y el ajuste de una gran selección de modelos candidatos (incluidos múltiples modelos de conjuntos apilados para un rendimiento superior) y, debido a la naturaleza distribuida de la plataforma de H2O, H2O AutoML puede escalar a conjuntos de datos muy grandes. El resultado de la ejecución de H2O AutoML es una \"tabla de clasificación\" de modelos fácilmente exportable para su uso en producción. Ejemplos de código en R y en Python estarán disponibles en GitHub para que les participantes puedan seguirlos en sus laptops (de todos modos, no es necesario que traigas tu laptop!).<\/p> <p>A lo largo de la charla, entonces, contarás con una breve descripción del campo del aprendizaje automático, seguida de una mirada detallada dentro del algoritmo AutoML de H2O.<\/p> <p>¿Te parece que este meetup no es para vos? Creemos que es una oportunidad única para conocer e interactuar con una de las mejores investigadoras de su disciplina en un ambiente relajado, amigable e inclusivo.<\/p> <p>¿El inglés te saca las ganas? Si querés hacerle alguna pregunta a Erin las organizadoras podemos ayudar.<\/p> <p>¡Ojalá te sumes! Además de la charla de Erin, vas a podér conocer más sobre R-Ladies y WiMLDS. También habrá tiempo para hacer sociales y nuevas conexiones.<\/p> <p>Nuestro compromiso: te vas a sentir muy bien y le vamos a poner la buena onda de siempre.<\/p> <p>En esta ocasión nos recibe generosamente Telecom quien también nos ofrecerá un rico catering acorde con esta ocasión tan especial.<\/p> <p>¡Nos vemos!<\/p> ",

Please arrive at 5:45pm for a 6pm start.<\/p> <p>The lecture will be followed by the Belz Dinner at 7:30pm. This will be at University House at the Woodward, on Level 10 of the same building as the lecture. Please book your spot for the dinner here: <a href=\"https://statsoc.org.au/event-3527803\" class=\"linkified\">https://statsoc.org.au/event-3527803<\/a><\/p> <p>Statistics is the Crown Jewel of Data Science<\/p> <p>Antony Ugoni (Director, Global Matching and Analytics, SEEK)<\/p> <p>Statistics has always been vitally important to Data Science, and its importance is growing. With data scientists in critically short supply, however, the discipline is attracting talented people from many different disciplines, each bringing different and complementary skills to a data science team.<\/p> <p>Integral to such a team's work involves tasks that are standard fare in statistics. Examples include statistical inference, experimental design, or supporting decision making under uncertainty. Powerful approaches to these are well known to experienced statisticians but not necessarily to many data scientists. What are some of these?<\/p> <p>Antony will share stories from his work leading data science teams in industry, illustrating examples where statistics has worked its magic. He will urge us to renew the wonder and amazement of our discipline as the best way to force our discipline to take its rightful place in the Data Science discipline, and inspire the statistics profession to pass this on to the new generation of data scientists.<\/p> <p>Biography:<\/p> <p>Antony is one of Australia’s leaders in analytics and in 2013 accepted an opportunity at SEEK to develop the analytics capability.<\/p> <p>Antony began his career as a Biostatistician to the Alfred Group of Hospitals jointly with Monash Medical School. He then moved to a lecturing role in Biostatistics at the University of Melbourne. Antony has co-authored more than 50 peer reviewed articles in medical research and still actively contributes to this industry today.<\/p> <p>From 2000 to 2013 Antony worked at National Australia Bank leading many ground breaking teams and projects. Antony started as the lead for its Credit Card Fraud Analytics Group which used data driven insights to reduce fraud losses by more than 50% in a market that was experiencing fraud losses growing at 30% per annum. Antony was then offered the opportunity to lead the Customer Analytics team which, in his tenure, identified more than $100b worth of revenue opportunities.<\/p> <p>Since 2013 Antony has worked at the Seek Group and founded the team that today is known as AI Platform Services. The AI Platform Services team are responsible for utilising the data captured by Seek assets to build services that help great candidates find jobs and stand out from the crowd, and hirers to identify great candidates in a timely fashion. Today the team numbers more than 100 Data Scientists, Data Engineers and Strategists, delivering services in 19 markets across the world, reaching 2.9 Billion candidates.<\/p> <p>Antony:<br/>* holds a BSc(Hons) and an MSc from La Trobe University,<br/>* is the Chairman of IAPA (The Institute of Analytics Professionals, Australia),<br/>* is a Board Member of AADL (The Australian Alliance for Data Leadership),<br/>* is a Board Member of ADMA (The Association for Data-Driven Marketing and Advertising),<br/>* is an Advisory Board member of the analytics start-up Pascal51, and<br/>* is an Advisory Board member for the Centre of Business Analytics, Melbourne Business School<\/p> ",

With high spatial heterogeneity and biological complexity, resected tumor samples present a significant characterization challenge, particularly when samples are scarce. Multiplexing in a single, intact tissue sample is required to identify cell types, understand biological pathways, and map cellular interactions.<\/p> <p>The past decade has seen the introduction of multiplexed immunofluorescence to establish the spatial relationships between various immune cells in tumor biology, in context. Histopathologists not only need to detect these multiple cell populations identified by specific protein markers, but also need to determine how they interact spatially, through a complex array of signaling markers. From upstream discovery, down to translational and clinical implementation, this multiplexing in situ need translates into high single-digit, even double-digit numbers of protein markers, to be imaged on single biopsy sections. Addressing this need, especially acute in immuno-oncology, Ultivue provides significant benefits of shorter panel validation, whole slide imaging at higher throughput without requiring dedicated instrumentation.<\/p> <p>Ultivue has developed a fully optimized, automated staining protocol on the Leica BOND RX platform. Such walkaway automation enables the staining of up to 30 slides per 4 to 5 hour run, with high reproducibility run-to-run and exceptional operator-to-operator consistency. Using our predefined UltiMapperTM I/O 5-plex kits on the BOND RX for research use only, Discovery, Translational and Clinical Research labs can implement easy and convenient multiplexed staining. Avoiding any linear unmixing after image acquisition, the UltiMapper I/O whole slide images are directly analyzed using the IndicaLabs HALO software, to derive cell counts, marker co-localization and proximity data.

Histopathologists not only need to detect these multiple cell populations identified by specific protein markers, but also need to determine how they interact spatially, through a complex array of signaling markers. From upstream discovery, down to translational and clinical implementation, this multiplexing in situ need translates into high single-digit, even double-digit numbers of protein markers, to be imaged on single biopsy sections.

    "group": "R-Ladies San Francisco",

    "description": "<p>\"Transitioning into the tidyverse\"<\/p> <p>• Description:<br/>Most people who learned R before the tidyverse have likely started to feel a nibble of pressure to get aboard the tidyverse train. Sadly a fact of human nature is that once you’re comfortable doing something a certain way, it’s hard to find the motivation to learn a different way of doing something that you already know how to do. While the tidyverse is primarily made up of a set of super useful R packages (ggplot2, dplyr, purrr, tidyr, readr, tibble), it is also a way of thinking about implementing “tidy” data analysis. If you combine tidy thinking with the tidy packages, you will inevitably become a master of tidy analysis. This talk will provide a guide for easing into the tidyverse for new users by first focusing on piping, dplyr, and ggplot2, and then providing short summaries and references for the remaining packages that form the tidyverse (and how they play together). Additional resources for continuing your tidyverse journey will be provided.<\/p> <p>• Target audience:<br/>People familiar with base R who want to familiarize themselves with the tidyverse, as well as those who have a little experience with the tidyverse and want a big picture of how it all fits together.<\/p> <p>The talk will be a combination of slides and live-coding, and is based on my two-part blog post on the tidyverse: <a href=\"http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/<\/a><\/p> <p>• Bio:<br/>Rebecca is a Statistics PhD Student at UC Berkeley as well as a Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS). Her dual passions are explaining “seemingly complicated” concepts to others in plain English, and exploring and presenting the stories that underlie complex datasets. She has dabbled in writing software as the author of the superheat R package for creating beautiful and customizable heatmaps in R. Rebecca also writes blog posts about R and statistics over at her website, www.rebeccabarter.com. When she's not doing R or stats stuff, she can usually be found climbing rocks somewhere, taking photos of beautiful places, or throwing wonky mugs and bowls at the pottery studio!<\/p> <p>================================================<br/>AGENDA:<br/>5:30pm - 6pm: Help with the setup (install R packages and anything else that is needed for the workshop)<br/>6pm - 6:30pm: Networking<br/>6:30pm - 7:45pm: Workshop<br/>7:45pm - 8pm: Networking<\/p> <p>================================================<br/>• Important to know<br/>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>Anyone who violates or has previously violated this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, meetup membership or other condition.<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a><\/p> <p>• The mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community.<\/p> <p>We are emphatically queer and trans-friendly.<\/p> <p>• Refreshments and food will be provided.<\/p> <p>A huge thank you to Sojern (<a href=\"https://www.sojern.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sojern.com/<\/a>) for hosting us!<\/p> ",

Az EDA alapvető fontosságú első lépés, megalapozza az adattisztítást, az adattranszformációt és a hipotézis felállítását. Miért? Mert ahhoz, hogy az adatot megtisztítsuk, tudnunk kell hol „piszkos” és milyen problémák vannak vele, az adatok transzformálása előtt pedig érdemes megismerni, hogy milyen értékekből tudunk dolgozni. A folyamat másik célja mintázatok, összefüggések megfigyelése az adathalmazban, amik mentén az elemzés későbbi lépéseiben tovább haladhatunk.<\/p> <p>Az anyag a 2019-es UseR! konferencián, Di Cook által tartott „Visualising High-Dimensional Data” című tutorial alapján állt össze. A workshopon röviden ismertetésre kerül az EDA története és fontosabb eszközei, ezután kódolás következik!<\/p> ",

Russ has been a bioinformatician at the University of Glasgow's Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre for the past 4 years, studying gene regulation in chronic myeloid leukaemia. R is his go-to tool for data analysis / visualisation / reporting, and he started coding in R about 10 years ago (alongside perl / python etc).

Martin is a PhD student at the Social and Public Health Sciences Unit. His PhD research is an evaluation of the implementation of the San Patrignano recovery enterprise model in Scotland, seeking to understand the influence of contextual factors on change mechanisms when transferring an intervention model to a substantially different setting.<\/p> <p>Come along to hear our two speakers.

You can obviously use whatever techniques you feel are appropriate, but the data will be organized in a way that tidyverse tools will work well!<\/p> <p>We will come together and work in teams helping each other solve this weeks TidyTuesday challenge. TidyTuesdays are a great way to improve R skills and get involved in the community!<\/p> <p>* To participate in TidyTuesday, you need to do a few things *<\/p> <p>Create and save an image of a plot from R<br/>- Save the code used to recreate your plot (include data tidy steps!)<br/>- Submit the plot and code on Twitter<br/>- Use the #TidyTuesday hashtag (you can also tag me @thomas_mock)<br/>- Browse other submissions and like/comment on their work!<\/p> <p>However, that might seem like a lot! So at minimum please submit your plot with the hashtag #TidyTuesday.<\/p> <p>* Rules for TidyTuesday *<\/p> <p>We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts to participate, but be mindful of a few things:<\/p> <p>- This is NOT about criticizing the original authors. They are people like you and me and they have feelings. Focus on the data, the charts and improving your own techniques.<br/>- This is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow #RStats practitioners! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like other’s posts and help promote the #RStats community!<br/>- The data set comes from the source article or the source that the article credits. Be mindful that the data is what it is and Tidy Tuesday is designed to help you practice data visualization and basic data wrangling.<br/>- Use the hashtag #TidyTuesday on Twitter if you create your own version and would like to share it.<br/>- Include a picture of the visualisation when you post to Twitter.<br/>- Include a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to Twitter. Comment your code wherever possible to help yourself and others understand your process!<br/>- Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with someting simple! - Make something quick, but purposeful!<br/>- Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>One of the most frustrating feelings for a Shiny app developer is to spend a tremendous amount of time on an app and then get an email from your stakeholder with a request like \"Can we move a dialogue box slightly to the left\" or \"Can we make this blue box more cerulean?\" It's best to deal with these picayune requests earlier during the requirements process so you can spend the majority of your time coding and not UX designing. Nate Mockler will go over how to easily create wireframes of your shiny app during the requirements process without becoming a UX designer.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<\/p> <p>Nate is a Sr. Data Scientist at Biogen, specifically creating analytics and interactive visualizations to analyze and explore clinical data. He has previously worked in analytics at Boehringer Ingelheim, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, and PRO Unlimited. He has presented at such conferences at PharmaSUG, PhUSE, and the Greater Boston UseR Group. He has passions for data visualizations and sushi, but has not figured out how to combine them yet.<\/p> <p>Additional info:<br/>* Please RSVP by Monday, September 30th<br/>* Light refreshments will be provided by Alkermes<br/>* Free parking available at the Alkermes office<br/>* Please enter through the 852 entrance to check-in with security<\/p> ",

The Meetup starts on 28th September and is a one day event.<br/>This Meetup is part of the Face Recognition Conference and an incredible chance to connect with both organizers, and individuals like you.<\/p> <p>Face recognition in static images and video sequences captured in unconstrained recording conditions is one of the most widely studied topics in computer vision due to its extensive applications in surveillance, law enforcement, bio-metrics, marketing, and so forth. Recently, methodologies that achieve good performance have been presented in top-tier computer vision conferences (e.g., ICCV, CVPR, ECCV etc.) and great progress has been achieved in face recognition with deep learning-based methods. Even though comprehensive benchmarks and extensive efforts exist for deep face recognition, very limited effort has been made towards benchmarking lightweight deep face recognition, which aims at model compactness and energy efficiency to enable efficient system deployment. In ICCV 2019, we make a significant step further and propose a new comprehensive benchmark, as well as organize the first challenge &amp; meetup for lightweight deep face recognition.<\/p> <p>Goal:<br/>Understand what AI is and it's applications in Face Recognition.<\/p> <p>What you'll learn:<br/>How to plan your career in Artificial Intelligence?<br/>Career path in Artificial Intelligence.<br/>Understanding Face Recognition and it's applications in day to day life.<\/p> <p>Ideal for:<br/>Anyone looking for career transformation and career guidance<br/>Who are interested in Artificial Intelligence?<br/>Graduates/Employees looking for upgrading skills<\/p> <p>Objectives of the Meetup:<br/>Understanding what Artificial Intelligence is<br/>Applications of AI in in different domains<br/>Understanding Face Recognition<br/>Applications of Face Recognition<\/p> ",

As most analyses require complete data, what to do with the missing values?<\/p> <p>An often used and easy solution to handle missing data is deleting incomplete rows and/or columns from the dataset. Is this method the most appropriate one, though? What other methods are available and what is their influence on the outcome of the analysis?<\/p> <p>The workshop has the following three parts.<br/>1. Missing Values Analysis<br/>What amount and what kind of missing data do I have in my dataset? What are possible reasons/mechanisms underlying the missingness?<br/>2. Evaluating Missing Data methods<br/>How do I know whether I choose the right missing data method? What should I take into account when deciding about a missing data method?<br/>3. Implementing Missing Data Methods<br/>How can I implement missing data methods in my analysis and/or in my pipeline?<\/p> <p>In our next workshop you will learn how to handle missing data in R.

When I studied Methodology and Statistics, I co-developed a procedure to generate missing data in complete datasets. I implemented the procedure in R-function ampute, and it is now part of imputation package mice.<\/p> <p>Then, I worked as an external PhD candidate under supervision of dr. Gerko Vink and prof. dr. Stef van Buuren. My work focused on the effect of missing data on prediction oriented analyses. Unfortunately, I had to quit with my research when I changed jobs and no more funding was available.<\/p> <p>Now, I work at Samen Veilig Midden-Nederland (i.e. a youth care organization) as Developer Data &amp; Analytics. It is my job to structure and standardize the analyses of sensitive and highly classified data. I mainly work with databases and visualization software and I lead several projects.<\/p> <p>REQUIREMENTS<br/>------------------------<br/>A basic knowledge of R is required.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct.

    "description": "<p>Literate Projecting<\/p> <p>\"Literate programming\" is an approach to writing software programs that weaves together the source code and documentation at the time of creation. The idea is to create programs that are easier for users to understand. But they are also easier for programmers to work on and maintain. In this talk, I will describe how data scientists can be inspired by this programming approach and start what I refer to as \"literate projecting.\" Literate projects are not only more pleasant to work on -- they are also easier for others to discover and explore. In my experiences as a researcher and now a data scientist at RStudio, I've had the pleasure to work on many literate projects, and I've felt the pain of working on illiterate ones too. What is the difference? What are the benefits? Based on my experiences, I'll share good literate projecting practices that have the potential to shift your mindset and reshape your workflow.<\/p> <p>Biography<\/p> <p>Alison Hill is a Data Scientist &amp; Professional Educator on the RStudio Education team, whose mission is to train the next million R users globally.

Arriving in Scotland 20 years ago, he initially worked as a research scientist in marine ecology. 10 years ago, he formally took on the job as data manager, and have since worked on opening up data and information about the Scottish Seas, improving the way in which data are stored, organised and published. He also collaborates with colleagues across the UK and Internationally through membership of various executive, advisory and expert groups on marine data management. But he also still dives into code, ancient paper records, and the occasional trip out to sea to collect more data.<\/p> <p>Talk Description: Have you ever tried to calculate the number of earth worms in your back garden using only a tea spoon? The task is not too dissimilar from what scientist need to do to quantify the number of fish we can catch to put on our plates, while ensuring there are enough fish to catch in following years. There is a long process of capturing data on fisheries activates, and fish stock abundances in Scottish waters and beyond. The base for much of this activity is at the Marine Laboratory in Aberdeen. This talk will take you through examples of technology used and data collected, to be able to provide scientific advice about the amount of fish we can catch while keeping Scottish Seas sustainable.<\/p> <p>Talk 2 - Dr Eyad Elyan<br/>Class-imbalanced datasets are common across different domains such as health, banking, security and others. With such datasets, the class of interest is significantly underrepresented in the dataset leading to biased results. This talk will present some of the latest work that has been developed at the School of Computing using advanced deep learning models, and discuss how it was applied to solve real-world scenarios including hand-written characters/digits recognition, and analysis of complex engineering drawings.<\/p> <p>Dr. Elyan has 20 yeas of experience in Academia and Industry. He obtained his first degree in Computer Science in 1999 from Al Quds University (Palestine). In 2004, he was awarded an MSc in Software Engineering with distinction. In 2008 at the University of Bradford obtained his PhD for his work on 3D modelling, representation, and recognition of human faces from 3D images.<\/p> <p>Currently, he is a Reader (Associate Professor) in Machine Learning at the School of Computing Science and Digital Media at Robert Gordon University and he is leading the Machine Learning and Vision Applications research group. His research in the area of machine learning and machine vision is primarily focused on creating novel methods to represent and extract knowledge from unstructured and complex documents and images and structured data and applying it to solve industrial problems.<\/p> <p>Elyan is a Fellow member of the British Higher Education Academy. He served as a Program Committee member for several international conferences and as a reviewer for several international journals in the area of machine vision, machine learning and data analytics and he has published more than 50 articles in the are of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Neural Network and Ensemble Learning.<\/p> <p>More information projects, research output and others can be found at <a href=\"https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/elyan-eyad\" class=\"linkified\">https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/elyan-eyad<\/a><\/p> <p>*****************************<br/>Thanks to MBN Solutions, Data Lab Scotland and Scotland IS for sponsoring this event.<\/p> <p>Photo by Sime Basioli on Unsplash<\/p> ",

We're kicking off our first event in October, sponsored by trivago (<a href=\"https://www.trivago.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.trivago.com/<\/a>), with three short talks:<\/p> <p>• How to find, evaluate and launch data business ideas (Daniel Kupka)<br/>• Practical reproducibility of analyses (Alex Dolphin)<br/>• Shiny development in an academic vs business setting (Praer Owlarn)<\/p> <p>*** Agenda ***<br/>• 18:30 - 19:00: Arrival, get a drink and socialise<br/>• 19:00 - 19:10: Quick introduction<br/>• 19:10 - 19:30: Daniel's Talk + Q&amp;A<br/>• 19:30 - 19:50: Alex's Talk + Q&amp;A<br/>• 19:50 - 20:10: Praer's Talk + Q&amp;A<br/>• 20:10 - Open End: Socialising<\/p> <p>*** How to find, evaluate and launch data business ideas (Daniel Kupka) ***<\/p> <p>-- abstract and speaker info coming soon --<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>*** Practical reproducibility of analyses (Alex Dolphin) ***<\/p> <p>In the pursuit of robust, reproducible, and extendable analyses, one key aspect frequently gets overlooked: practicality. Reproducible analyses with a potential for good review are often cumbersome to write: they may require branches to be pulled, environments to be built, and variables to be changed in a well-hidden file. I will propose a step towards greater practicality with an example using three technologies many data scientists know to some extent:<br/>- RMarkdown<br/>- R shiny server<br/>- Docker<\/p> <p>By presenting this concept I hope to demonstrate that it is possible for:<br/>- data scientists to review the live code with one link to a shiny-rendered page<br/>- non-data-scientists to rerun and extend the analysis through an intuitive GUI<br/>- the data scientist doing the task to achieve this only writing one file in their preferred coding language<\/p> <p>Alex Dolphin is a Data Scientist in the Marketplace Intelligence team of trivago. He has worked for 3 years in the Data Science function, and comes from a background of Mathematics at university. He believes that data scientists should have access to highly-reliable data and well-maintained tools as a minimum to produce quality output.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>*** Shiny development in an academic vs business setting (Praer Owlarn) ***<\/p> <p>Shiny is a popular R package for building interactive web apps – no web development knowledge required (<a href=\"https://shiny.rstudio.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://shiny.rstudio.com<\/a>)! Its ease-of-use and extendibility makes it popular in both academic and business settings, but implementation in the two environments can be rather different. I’ll share my experience writing shiny apps at a Max Planck Institute (a non-profit research institute) and trivago (a German hotel search engine), and how differences in task complexity, IT infrastructure and organisational mindset affected my approaches and the packages I used.<\/p> <p>Praer Owlarn is a data analyst at trivago. After a decade as a biologist, she decided to learn a little R and immediately fell in love! Soon, she waved goodbye to the bench and is now having fun diving into big data sets, exploring/contributing to R packages and building shiny apps.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Thanks to trivago for hosting &amp; sponsoring this edition of the Düsseldorf R User Group Meetup. There will be food and drinks available.<\/p> ",

This may improve the overall healthcare system and associated policies drastically in the next few years. This session is focussed on the following topics:<\/p> <p>• Introduction and importance of Machine Learning in Medical Applications<br/>• Current Market Trends<br/>• Introduction to Cancer Dataset and Significance<br/>• Visualization of Dataset<br/>• Understand the dataset<br/>• Feature Selection and Random Forest Classification<br/>• Feature Extraction<br/>• Estimation and Classification<br/>• How to improve the results, understand the parameters.<br/>• Deployment strategy &amp; Cost Estimation<\/p> <p>12:00pm – 12:15pm | TEA &amp; SNACKS<\/p> <p>12:15pm – 01:15pm | SESSION 2<br/>Developing more specialized chips and reducing the computation required during deep learning is very important to execute an optimised, resource efficient deep learning model on the edge device itself. This is known as “AI on the edge” and could benefit from specialized, fixed chip architectures that are more efficient. Datacentres that power “AI on the cloud” on the other hand, would run on fully scalable and programmable chip architectures, to handle a much broader spectrum of learning tasks.

It is told through Jahren’s stories: about her childhood in rural Minnesota with an uncompromising mother and a father who encouraged hours of play in his classroom’s labs; about how she found a sanctuary in science, and learned to perform lab work done “with both the heart and the hands”; and about the inevitable disappointments, but also the triumphs and exhilarating discoveries, of scientific work.<\/p> <p>Yet at the core of this book is the story of a relationship Jahren forged with a brilliant, wounded man named Bill, who becomes her lab partner and best friend. Their sometimes rogue adventures in science take them from the Midwest across the United States and back again, over the Atlantic to the ever-light skies of the North Pole and to tropical Hawaii, where she and her lab currently make their home.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>What will we cover in this hands-on workshop?<br/>To get data into R, the first step is to import it. It’s very common to get data from databases, csv files, Excel files, APIs, or from websites through HTML tables. One less common but tricky way to get data is from PDFs. PDFs come in 2 forms - machine readable and non-machine readable. Dr. Stephanie Zimmer will give examples of both and discuss some tricks and tips she's learned to get these data into R so they can be analyzed. The bulk of the work will be done by two packages: pdftools and tesseract. We will also use the tidyverse package to parse data once it's in R.<\/p> <p>What's the schedule?<br/>6:00pm - 6:15pm - Networking<br/>6:15pm - 6:35pm - Lightning Talks* (Karen Jin)<br/>6:35pm - 6:45pm - Set up (install R packages, etc.)<br/>6:45pm - 7:45pm - Workshop<br/>7:45pm - 8:00pm - Wrap up<\/p> <p>*We are looking for Lightning Talk presenters! Please email Sheila at [masked] or message her on Meetup if you are interested in giving a five minute Lightning Talk.<\/p> <p>What should I bring?<br/>Please bring your own (fully charged) laptop.<\/p> <p>What about parking?<br/>The best place to park for this event is the Bryan Center Garage on Science Drive. It is $1 for 30 minutes.<\/p> <p>Who should come?<br/>Beginners are welcome and encouraged to join this event but please install the most recent version of R as well as RStudio on your laptop before attending this meetup event. Experienced R users are also encouraged to update their versions of R and RStudio as well as their R packages (in RStudio go to Tools &gt; Check for package updates...). Here are links to free downloads for R (<a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://cran.r-project.org/<\/a>) and RStudio (<a href=\"https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download<\/a>). Downloading and installing both of these programs before this meetup will help us keep on schedule and make sure you learn the most you can while at the meetup event.<\/p> <p>All events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.<\/p> ",

The tools that<br/>we build for personalization, marketing, and advertising are being<br/>directly leveraged by actors with political and ideological<br/>motivations. Engineering ethics require that we understand and face<br/>the consequences of the tools that we're building, and work to<br/>mitigate the harmful externalities of the tools and technologies that<br/>we create.<\/p> <p>To understand the harm, and how to mitigate it, we need to take a<br/>cross-functional look at what we're building. In particular, we need<br/>to look at our products through not just a data science lens, but also<br/>through the lenses of security, economics, and information and<br/>psychological operations.<\/p> <p>In this talk we'll look at modern data driven advertising and<br/>personalization and understand how they can be leveraged for harmful<br/>political and idealogical activities, including as tools for<br/>information and psychological warfare.

    "start": "2019-11-14",
    "description": "<p>The Timeseries Talks are Back! We are very excited to have David Rawlinson and Gideon Kowadlo from Project AGI present a cutting edge RNN talk.<\/p> <p>David and Gideon present a recurrent neural network memory that uses sparse coding to create a combinatoric encoding of sequential inputs. Using several examples, they show that the network can associate distant causes and effects in a discrete stochastic process, predict partially-observable higher-order sequences, and enable a DQN agent to navigate a maze by giving it memory. The network uses only biologically-plausible, local and immediate credit assignment. Memory requirements are typically one order of magnitude less than existing LSTM, GRU and autoregressive feed-forward sequence learning models. The most significant limitation of the memory is generalization to unseen input sequences. They explore this limitation by measuring next-word prediction perplexity on the Penn Treebank dataset.<\/p> <p>About the speakers:<\/p> <p>David Rawlinson<br/>David has been working in applied AI/ML for approximately 20 years in both industry and academia. These include finance &amp; retail business analytics, security / surveillance, and med-tech particularly genomics, bioinformatics and medical imaging. Many of these systems are used everyday in the real world from banking and parking enforcement to radiology and monitoring of financial transactions in many countries around the world. He studied computer science &amp; artificial intelligence at Sussex University (UK) back at the end of the AI winter, later moving to Monash University in Australia to complete a PhD in computer vision for mobile robots. Afterwards he worked for Melbourne University and Data61 (formerly NICTA) for several years. David now works on research towards more general purpose machine learning looking at alternative methods of credit assignment and continuous learning.<\/p> <p>Gideon Kowadlo<br/>Gideon has spent 20+ years bringing emerging technologies to life in Australia and overseas, in areas from Robotics to Human Motor Control and from Mobile to Bio-inspired AI.

    "description": "<p>Computer vision is challenging, but recent advances in image processing have paved the way for solutions to a number of practical applications. This talk is about the broader class of image processing methods for extracting information from video and images. We’ll start from the beginning with an introduction to the topic, applications for data science, and current capabilities of the state-of-the-art. Then we'll explore some of the fundamental techniques used to analyze images/video including deep neural network models. Finally, we end with an example of how these techniques come together to solve the problem of counting people walking by a street cam.<\/p> <p>About the speaker:<\/p> <p>Scott Thibault is a local-area entrepreneur and worked in the electronic design automation and embedded systems domains for more than two decades. He has also worked for many years in “big data” for a health care startup as an architect of their streaming data platform.

    "description": "<p>Winner of the 2019 Burlington Data Science Golden Flame Award, Katie McCurdy will expand on the very popular talk she gave at our rapid fire session last January.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THIS TALK...<br/>Our communication with our doctors is broken. Ineffective processes and systems prevent us from telling rich stories – the kind we need to fully understand each other. As a result, many patients aren't getting the correct diagnosis; 12 million people in the U.S. are misdiagnosed or remain undiagnosed each year. Patients with invisible symptoms or those who have especially complicated backgrounds suffer most. They often aren't understood or believed by their doctors, and they end up repeating their stories over and over.<\/p> <p>Visuals can help us communicate more efficiently and develop a better mutual understanding. Presenter and designer Katie McCurdy has experienced this firsthand; as a patient with multiple autoimmune conditions, she has used drawings, graphs, timelines and other visuals in her doctor appointments to make better use of our short time together and help them ‘see’ what she is experiencing.<\/p> <p>These experiences inspired her to start a company called Pictal Health to bring visual communication to more patients and doctors. Pictal Health helps people put together detailed timelines, symptom maps, and a neat and organized summary of their health history so that they can see and understand what happened, tell their story with confidence, and work together better with their doctors.<\/p> <p>After piloting an intensive, supportive health history visualization process with over 50 patients and healthcare providers, Katie has learned key insights about how others represent their symptoms and stories, what elements of our stories are important to ‘show’ to our doctors, how to avoid overwhelming visual representations, and more. She is excited to share all of this with you!<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKER...<br/>Katie McCurdy is an autoimmune patient, designer, and founder of Pictal Health. She is on a mission to use visual communication and human-centered design to help patients tell their stories, help providers focus on the work they love, and facilitate better collaboration between all healthcare stakeholders.<\/p> <p>Before starting Pictal Health, Katie consulted with the University of Vermont Medical Center, working to improve the patient and provider experience using human-centered design. Prior to that, she designed apps and products for startups Medal, Medivo, and Notabli; health data non-profit Open mHealth; and clients like LabCorp, Verizon and Johnson &amp; Johnson.<\/p> <p>She holds a Masters of Science in Information with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction from the University of Michigan School of Information. She lives, skis, hikes, and eats chocolate in Burlington, VT. Learn more about Katie at katiemccurdy.com.<\/p> ",
