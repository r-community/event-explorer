Joint modelling approaches are used to study these two types of data simultaneously to assess the effect of longitudinal biomarkers on time-to-event data. The first joint modelling proposals have been based on a relationship between one single longitudinal biomarker and time-to-event data. Recently, several extensions have been developed for multivariate longitudinal and survival data, for non-linear longitudinal and survival data, to use different association structures between the longitudinal biomarker and patients` survival and for personalized dynamic predictions of time-to-event data. In this talk, we will focus on the recent developments of joint models from both frequentist and Bayesian perspective, with developed R packages.<\/p> <p>Speaker: Ipek Guler<\/p> <p>I am Ipek Guler born in Turkey in 1986, after finishing my University degree in Gazi University, Ankara, I have started to my master degree in University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain where I have specialized in applied statistical techniques.

Even if you aren't currently dealing with big data, chances are that sooner or later you'll find yourself with a dataset that is just too big for your normal R setup to handle.<\/p> <p>At this meetup in collaboration with CopenhagenR, Rasmus Bååth, data science lead at Castle.io, will share three strategies that can be used to tackle big data in R (and python if that's your cup of tea). Three big data tools will be briefly introduced: duckDB, Spark and SnowflakeDB.<\/p> <p>The CopenhagenR meetup is ramping up again and invites you to join this event aimed at everybody working with or interested in data science.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKERS<\/p> <p>Rasmus Bååth - Rasmus is a data science lead at Castle.io, a Y combinator-backed startup building an AI-based security and fraud detection service. He's worked with big data in many different forms and knows that, while it can be a pain to handle big data, there can be great business value (and good career opportunities) knowing how to do so.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Whether you are a beginner or are needing a refresh, you can join this training to gain familiarity with the statistical programming language R and learn how to take your data and reporting to the next level.<\/p> <p>We have developed this intro level training to give people a leg up to get started toward reporting and dashboards in R - we would appreciate if you could share with potentially interested colleagues outside of the group. Hope to see some of you there, too!<\/p> <p>ABOUT THIS EVENT:<br/>Have you got lots of ideas of what you want to do with your data but just can’t get there yet? Over 5 sessions we will look into the basics of the statistical programming language R and how it can be applied to data visualisation and automated report generation. We cover data cleaning and pre-processing, transforming your data, displaying it in multiple formats (data table and plots), and finally tying it all together in a R Markdown file that you can save and share with your audience. We will work through multiple datasets and exercises so on conclusion of the class you can hit the ground running.<\/p> <p>WHO SHOULD ATTEND:<br/>You are new to R or feel a bit rusty with your R skills and have a keen interest in furthering your ability to manage, display and share data. Maybe you have been mainly using Excel or an off-the shelf tool like Power BI, but are frustrated by its limitations and are keen to build more advanced visuals to do your data justice. You might have a dataset or model you want to prepare outputs for and want to progress to a more powerful, efficient and streamlined process. This Masterclass can be used as an entry into R or can be used as preparation for our R Shiny Masterclasses.<\/p> <p>INSTRUCTORS:<br/>Dr. Uli Muellner (Director — IT &amp; Information Design)<br/>Crystal Johnston (Full-Stack Developer)<br/>Nick Snellgrove (Full-Stack Developer)<\/p> <p>FORMAT:<br/>5 interactive online sessions; supported by dedicated online learning plattform for asynchronous learning and interaction.<\/p> <p>COST<br/>$985 NZD (excl.

We will have the great pleasure to be monthly hosting amazing guests! For the next few months we will focus on some of the powerful data visualization packages that are available in the programming language R.<\/p> <p>We are delighted to be hosting Thomas Lin Pedersen who will walk through the tidygraph package in R (<a href=\"https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/<\/a>). Thomas Lin Pedersen is a software engineer at RStudio focusing on developing and maintaining the various packages that makes data visualisation possible in R. He is the maintainer of ggplot2 and the developer of a range of extensions such as patchwork, ggforce, and gganimate. In the spare time, Thomas makes generative art created with R using the same tools as he develops for data visualisation.<\/p> <p>➡️ Place: Zoom<br/>➡️ Date/Time: December 2, 2021 from 7PM to 9PM Tunisian time (UTC +1)<\/p> <p>We recommend you to have a look at the convenient world clock website <a href=\"https://lnkd.in/gUAZxQM\" class=\"linkified\">https://lnkd.in/gUAZxQM<\/a> if you're struggling to find the right time according to your time zone.<\/p> <p>➡️ About the workshop:<br/>Working with network data can be daunting for people used to the more classic tabular data types. The packages tidygraph and ggraph have been developed to bring some of the familiarity of dplyr and ggplot2 to working with network data with the hope that more people will be comfortable wrangling and analysing this type of data. This workshop will introduce the core concepts of network data and show how it can be tamed with the help of tidygraph and ggraph.<\/p> <p>In order to attend the meetup, please fill out this short form 👉 <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/4srp7y66\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/4srp7y66<\/a><\/p> <p>We will send you the Zoom link a few hours before the training session.

    "description": "<p>Abbiamo il piacere di annunciare un nuovo meetup in collaborazione con KNIME (knime.com).<\/p> <p>Il (Virtual) Learnathon è un evento a metà tra un hackathon e un workshop: è un workshop perché si studia il processo di data science. Ma è anche un hackathon, perché si lavora in gruppi, attraverso esercizi, per mettere a punto la soluzione.<\/p> <p>Durante il Learnathon sperimenteremo l’intero ciclo di un progetto di data science dall’accesso ai dati fino al deployment, passando per un paio di algoritmi di Machine Learning.<\/p> <p>Lo strumento che utilizzeremo è KNIME Analytics Platform (<a href=\"https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform<\/a>).<br/>KNIME Analytics Platform è open ed offre anche un ambiente di sviluppo integrato per R, Python, SQL e Spark.<\/p> <p>Dopo un’introduzione iniziale ci divideremo in gruppi. Ciascun gruppo si focalizzerà su uno dei tre aspetti del ciclo del progetto:<\/p> <p>Gruppo 1: ETL. Focus sull’accesso ai dati e sulla data preparation.<br/>Gruppo 2: Machine Learning. Che modello dovrei usare? Con quali parametri?<br/>Gruppo 3: Deployment. Dopo aver trovato un buon modello, cosa succede? Focus sulla fase di deployment.<\/p> <p>Per via della situazione attuale non sarà possibile incontrarsi di persona. In alternative, tutti potranno scaricare il materiale del workshop qui:<br/>tinyurl.com/RLadies-KNIME-2021 (slides)<br/>download.knime.org/evangelism/Learnathon/From_Raw_Data_To_Deployment.knar (workflows)<\/p> <p>Forniremo ai partecipanti i data sets, i workflow per cominciare e le soluzioni degli esercizi.<br/>Data scientists esperti saranno a disposizione per consigli e informazioni.<\/p> <p>Per partecipare è necessario portare il proprio laptop con KNIME Analytics Platform preinstallata e il materiale del workshop.<\/p> <p>Per installare KNIME Analytics Platform (<a href=\"https://www.knime.com/downloads\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.knime.com/downloads<\/a>), seguite le istruzioni in questi video:<br/>- Windows (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/yeHblDxakLk\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/yeHblDxakLk<\/a>)<br/>- Mac (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/1jvRWryJ220\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/1jvRWryJ220<\/a>)<br/>- Linux (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/wibggQYr4ZA\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/wibggQYr4ZA<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Infine, se si desidera arrivare più preparati sullo strumento, è possibile seguire il corso gratuito in modalità e-learning: <a href=\"https://www.knime.com/knime-introductory-course\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.knime.com/knime-introductory-course<\/a><\/p> <p>Dopo un’introduzione su Zoom mostreremo come spostarci su Gather (info: <a href=\"https://gather.town\" class=\"linkified\">https://gather.town<\/a>) per dividerci in gruppi e comunicare informalmente su una mappa interattiva. E’ raccomandato usare Google Chrome una volta su Gather.<\/p> <p>• 18:00 : Presentazione di Benvenuto da parte delle R Ladies (Zoom)<br/>• 18:05 : Introduzione a KNIME Analytics Platform (Zoom)<br/>• 18:25 : Presentazione del workshop (Zoom)<br/>• 18:45 : Let’s work &amp; learn!

    "description": "<p>Please welcome our speaker, David Aponte, PhD Candidate in medical science at the University of Calgary.<\/p> <p>Shiny is an R framework for interacting with data through a web app. If you have complex data that is either continuously updated or big enough for people to explore for their own insights, Shiny is a fantastic library for creating visual tools to open up your data to the broader community. Shiny apps can easily be deployed to the web, allowing others to leverage your data and analyses without the fuss of installing anything or writing code.<\/p> <p>In this workshop, we will learn the basics of making a Shiny application, starting with how you can take your existing analyses and make them work with user selectable inputs. We’ll also go over some tips for making your Shiny app work efficiently and look slick. Finally, we will go over deploying your Shiny application to a live website for anyone to use.<\/p> <p>If you’d like to follow along with the workshop, make sure to download the Github repository from <a href=\"https://github.com/J0vid/CalgaryR_Shiny\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/J0vid/CalgaryR_Shiny<\/a> The GitHub readme briefly outlines the goals of the workshop, as well as potential future topics.<\/p> <p>About the speaker:<\/p> <p>David Aponte is a PhD Candidate in medical science at the University of Calgary. His dissertation work has focused on how genetic variation produces facial shape variation in mice and humans. He has used R for a wide array of projects like measuring color patterns from image data and identifying genetic syndromes from measurements of facial shape.<\/p> <p>Please join us and learn together.<\/p> ",

The packages tidygraph and ggraph have been developed to bring some of the familiarity of dplyr and ggplot2 to working with network data with the hope that more people will be comfortable wrangling and analysing this type of data. This workshop will introduce the core concepts of network data and show how it can be tamed with the help of tidygraph and ggraph.<\/p> <p>In order to attend the meetup, please fill out this short form<br/>👉 <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/4srp7y66\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/4srp7y66<\/a><\/p> <p>A Zoom link will be sent a few hours before the training session.

Now seamlessly integrating metadata into data visualizations is nice and easy and all those minor tweaks your boss asks for don’t have to be an extra source of stress.<\/p> <p>Alison just recently graduated with her PhD from Thomas Jefferson University and is now working at Rajant Health Inc as a Computational Biologist. She absolutely loves coding in R and gets way too much enjoyment out of writing and debugging functions to make data analysis and visualizations easy and consistent.<\/p> <p>2)<br/>Jess Streeter presents: Nerdify your life<\/p> <p>Learn about Spring Health's internal package, Nerdify, and how it has streamlined several internal processes across our growing data team.<\/p> <p>Jess is a Senior Data Scientist at Spring Health. She has spent her entire career working on issues around mental health. When she's not coding away, she enjoys spending time with her family, drinking good beer, and training Jiu Jitsu.<\/p> <p>3)<br/>Jake Riley presents: rocqi - simplifying workflows &amp; reducing technical debt<\/p> <p>Learn about one of CHOP’s internal R packages, rocqi. We built this package to improve the process for accessing, formatting, and visualizing data. Categories include quick and easy database connections, ggplot themes, Rmd/dashboard templates, internal datasets, and many helper functions for presenting data to stakeholders. In this talk I’ll discuss the types of solutions we chose to tackle and how package development has made us all better programmers.<\/p> <p>Jake is a Senior Data Analyst at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He works with the Analytics Architecture team to provide centralized solutions for a large team of analysts.

Joint modelling approaches are used to study these two types of data simultaneously to assess the effect of longitudinal biomarkers on time-to-event data. The first joint modelling proposals have been based on a relationship between one single longitudinal biomarker and time-to-event data. Recently, several extensions have been developed for multivariate longitudinal and survival data, for non-linear longitudinal and survival data, to use different association structures between the longitudinal biomarker and patients` survival and for personalized dynamic predictions of time-to-event data. In this talk, we will focus on the recent developments of joint models from both frequentist and Bayesian perspective, with developed R packages.<\/p> <p>Speaker: Ipek Guler<\/p> <p>I am Ipek Guler born in Turkey in 1986, after finishing my University degree in Gazi University, Ankara, I have started to my master degree in University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain where I have specialized in applied statistical techniques. During my master studies, I had different internships in Clinical Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, IDICHUS and a spin-off company and I focused my research on longitudinal and survival data.<\/p> <p>I have worked in several research projects as a researcher in biostatistics group of University of Santiago de Compostela during 6 years, as a statistical consultant in Maimonides Biomedical Research Institute of Córdoba (IMIBIC) for 2 years and also have worked in national Covid registry data with the Spanish Internal Medicine Society (SEMI).

If you do not already have R and Python installed, please be sure to do so before the event on December 15th. Find our installation instructions for R/RStudio, Python/Anaconda, and required packages on the event's GitHub README: <a href=\"https://github.com/samanthacsik/RLadiesSB-RvsPython\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/samanthacsik/RLadiesSB-RvsPython<\/a><\/p> <p>We will be available to help troubleshoot any setup issues on 12/07 from 5:30-6:30pm via Zoom: <a href=\"https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/81620992244?pwd=d2ZQTCtwZVZvU3Q4M25FN1hIM1Fxdz09\" class=\"linkified\">https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/81620992244?pwd=d2ZQTCtwZVZvU3Q4M25FN1hIM1Fxdz09<\/a>.<\/p> <p>This will be a hybrid in-person/remote event. We are excited to begin meeting/networking with our communities once again, but understand that not everyone may be comfortable attending events in person still. We will do our best to answer questions for those attending virtually, but please understand that we may be slow to respond as we navigate our first hybrid event.<\/p> <p>PLEASE NOTE: Masks are required for in-person attendance and vaccination status will be verified at the door.<\/p> <p>DIRECTIONS: This event will be held at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at 1021 Anacapa St. Our offices conveniently sit at SB city lot #8. The first 75min of parking are free and $1.50 per hour after that. Street parking is also available on the surrounding streets.

We will hold our event via Zoom, where you can meet other R-ladies, improve your R skills, and build your data science portfolio. This event is for people at all levels of R (beginner through advanced).<\/p> <p>This will be the second part of a multipart TidyTuesday event where we will be looking at a local (!) urban heat mapping dataset brought to us by collaborators at the Museum of Life and Science (<a href=\"https://www.lifeandscience.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.lifeandscience.org/<\/a>) and the State Climate Office of NC (<a href=\"https://climate.ncsu.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://climate.ncsu.edu/<\/a>).

A new data set and accompanying article featuring an interesting plot is released on Github every Monday. The goal is to generate a copy of the original plot or create your own original approach!<\/p> <p>For more information on #tidytuesday, check out this blog post (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2HqEsdt\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2HqEsdt<\/a>) and the main repository page (<a href=\"https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday<\/a>).<\/p> <p>Who is this for?<br/>New and experienced R users alike! Let's learn together! All are welcome, including R-Ladies RTP members and R-Ladies from around the world.<\/p> <p>What should I bring?<br/>You'll need a computer with videoconferencing capabilities and R. Serve yourself a beverage and a snack to fuel your evening!<\/p> <p>Where will it take place?<br/>**Please join us online via Zoom.** A link to join will be provided when you RSVP.<\/p> <p>All events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.<\/p> ",

Ma è anche un hackathon, perché si lavora in gruppi, attraverso esercizi, per mettere a punto la soluzione.<\/p> <p>Durante il Learnathon sperimenteremo l’intero ciclo di un progetto di data science dall’accesso ai dati fino al deployment, passando per un paio di algoritmi di Machine Learning.<\/p> <p>Lo strumento che utilizzeremo è KNIME Analytics Platform (<a href=\"https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform<\/a>).<br/>KNIME Analytics Platform è open ed offre anche un ambiente di sviluppo integrato per R, Python, SQL e Spark.<\/p> <p>Dopo un’introduzione iniziale ci divideremo in gruppi. Ciascun gruppo si focalizzerà su uno dei tre aspetti del ciclo del progetto:<\/p> <p>Gruppo 1: ETL. Focus sull’accesso ai dati e sulla data preparation.<br/>Gruppo 2: Machine Learning. Che modello dovrei usare? Con quali parametri?<br/>Gruppo 3: Deployment. Dopo aver trovato un buon modello, cosa succede? Focus sulla fase di deployment.<\/p> <p>Per via della situazione attuale non sarà possibile incontrarsi di persona.

Millions of documents can be created as part of one trial and are stored in a document management system. In case migrating these documents to a new system is needed - for example, when a pharma company acquires the rights to a drug or trial - all these documents must often be read manually in order to classify them and extract metadata that is legally required and must be accurate.

While one of Shiny’s greatest strengths is that it allows producing web applications solely from R code, meeting client’s more delicate expectations will often involve going beyond R code and work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We recognize that R developers tend not to be familiar with the latter as they generally do not have significant background in web development, these may therefore appear daunting at first. In this talk, I’ll present my journey toward the creation of the RinteRface organization, powering many Shiny extensions like bs4Dash or shinyMobile as well as the work in progress “Outstanding user interfaces with Shiny” book (<a href=\"https://divadnojnarg.github.io/outstanding-shiny-ui/\" class=\"linkified\">https://divadnojnarg.github.io/outstanding-shiny-ui/<\/a>), exposing some keys to design amazing user experiences.<\/p> <p>###<\/p> <p>Thomas Lo Russo -- Statistical Office of the Canton of Zurich, Data Scientist, Maintainer of the swissdd-package, <a href=\"https://www.tlorusso.ch\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tlorusso.ch<\/a><\/p> <p>Title: Anomaly Detection on Vote Sundays with R &amp; Shiny<\/p> <p>Abstract: TBA<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Please welcome our speaker, Cherri Zhang, Data Manager and Analyst, Department of Psychology, University of Calgary. We are meeting virtually on Wednesday, January 12, 2022, at 5:30 pm<\/p> <p>Abstract<\/p> <p>Background: Diagnosis and management of concussion depends on post-concussive symptom (PCS) ratings. One approach to validation of PCS rating scales is to examine their factor structure and to test measurement invariance (MI).<\/p> <p>Purpose: To validate the underlying construct of survey instruments across raters, groups, and time using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and MI through the implementation of lavaan package in R.<\/p> <p>Methods: Four models were implemented: correlated two- and three-factor models and bifactor models with two and three specific factors across four levels of MI. MI is a stepwise approach that compares nested models by adding increasingly stringent constraints to model parameters. The MI levels are configural, weak, strong, and strict. Models were compared using fit indices such as root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI). MI is established when the fit of the more stringent model (e.g., strong invariance) is no worse compared to the one with more relaxed assumptions (e.g., weak invariance), as indicated by fit statistics. Additionally, OmegaH was used to assess the bifactor models to estimate the proportion of observed variance in total and subscale scores that could be attributed to the underlying factors.<\/p> <p>Results: The bifactor models displayed better fit indices; however, model convergence took up to several hours with the three-factor model having convergence problems during initial CFA. The correlated models showed greater parsimony, shorter convergence time, and less convergence issues. Strong to strict invariance were established in all models.<\/p> <p>Conclusion: The findings support a two-factor model of the Health Behaviour Inventory (HBI). The bifactor model showed the best fit, suggesting that ratings on the HBI also can be captured by a general factor. The results provide further validation of the HBI, supporting its use in childhood concussion research and clinical practice.<\/p> <p>Please join us and learn together.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Join us for a new session on the 25th of January, 7PM EET ! We continue our meetups with #goodRvibes and a challenge to engage in new habits.<\/p> <p>Title: Build a new habit in 2022! Tidy Tuesday<\/p> <p>#TidyTuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. An emphasis is placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem.<\/p> <p>This meetup will be hands-on: after a brief introduction of #TidyTuesday and the weekly dataset, everyone will have a chance to explore the data and then share their work. Whether you want to practice exploratory visualization, apply a new analytical technique, try out a new plot theme or just learn tidyverse things from others, #TidyTuesday is for you.<\/p> <p>To get a sense for #TidyTuesday ahead of time, check out the hashtag on Twitter, explore past datasets or check out David Robinson's screencasts below:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday<\/a><br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ<\/a><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Registration is free, but mandatory via meetup.
