Data provenance---the history of data and how it was computed---underlies reproducibility of and trust in data analyses. Our work focuses on collecting data provenance from R scripts and providing tools that use the provenance to increase the reproducibility of and trust in analyses done in R. Specifically, our ProvTools use data provenance to document the computing environment and inputs and outputs of a script's execution, support script debugging and exploration, and explain differences in behavior across repeated execution of the same script. Use of ProvTools can help both the original author and later users of a script reproduce and trust its results.<\/p> <p>Adam Fox (MassMutual): Effective Monitoring of Production Models<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data scientists can deliver significant value by automating or enhancing business processes using predictive models. There is also opportunity for these models to cause damage by producing invalid output as a result of data errors or population shifts. These systems must therefore be carefully monitored for problematic data. In this talk I will present MassMutual's model monitoring infrastructure and invite discussion on best practices<\/p> ",

At its heart is `map()` and friends: functions for the common pattern of iterating over a vector or list, doing something to each element, and then storing the results. These functions let you iterate efficiently and with less code.

In this presentation, I will introduce the steps to set up the platform to run Keras in R and give you an overview of the concepts of neural network (NN) and deep learning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN). In the end, we will analyze a dataset using the Keras package.<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Jo Hardin (@jo_hardin47), Professor, Pomona College<br/>Title: reticulate: running Python within RStudio<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>A quick google search can quickly bring up many arguments on both sides of the heated Python vs R debate. I don’t take sides in that conversation, but I do recognize the value of knowing both languages and the power of being able to use one language inside software designed for the other. Whatever computational environment is used to execute instructions to the computer, it can be illuminating to see different implementations of the same syntax producing the same results, or alternatively, implementation of different syntax producing the same result. In this talk, I discuss running Python in the RStudio environment. I provided a series of examples in R Markdown chunks (both Python chunks and R chunks).

    "description": "<p># Introduction<\/p> <p>Malcolm has been interning with RStudio and working on a package, ymlthis, which will allow you too write YAML code using R. The goal is to make it easier to create the metadata needed by markdown, bookdown, blogdown and other frameworks used in R.<\/p> <p>R and Python are both popular languages in Data Science. There is no need to limit yourself to just one. Michael will show us how to incorporate python into your R workflow.<\/p> <p>Come early, network, enjoy the food and talks.<\/p> <p># Schedule<br/>6:30 - 6:50 Networking<br/>6:50 - 7:00 Welcome &amp; general announcement<br/>7:00 - 7:30 The YAML problem: Writing and working with YAML with ymlthis<br/>7:30 - 8:00 Snakes in the Studio: Adding Python to your R Workflow<br/>8:00 - Raffle<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Networking and Clean-up<\/p> <p># Talk 1<\/p> <p>## Title: The YAML problem: Writing and working with YAML with ymlthis<br/>## Speaker: Malcolm Barrett<br/>## Abstract<br/>R Markdown is an easy-to-learn tool for reproducible research. Many people, however, bump into problems using YAML, the language that specifies metadata for R Markdown documents. ymlthis makes it easy to write valid YAML by handling the syntax and documenting the majority of YAML fields in one place. ymlthis will help you write metadata for R Markdown, bookdown, blogdown, and more. Let the Shiny add-in create a new R Markdown file for you or work with YAML and R Markdown files directly. ymlthis finally gives you a workflow that is better than trying to find and paste the YAML from the last R Markdown document you used.<\/p> <p># Talk 2<\/p> <p>## Title: Snakes in the Studio: Adding Python to your R Workflow<br/>## Speaker: Michael Espero<br/>## Abstract<br/>R and Python are among the most widely used programming languages for analysts and data scientists. While it’s great to feel comfortable in one open-source statistical programming language, you may encounter peers who prefer another. This walk-through aims to share some of RStudio’s versatility as we touch on useful commonalities between data science workflows in R and Python with attention to simple approaches to loading, wrangling, visualizing, and modelling publicly available data.<\/p> ",

We will have two featured talks:<\/p> <p>*Michael Enquist* will be talking about Association Rules in R and how to apply them to grocery shopping. Association rules are statements that help to find patterns in seemingly unrelated data or a relational database (information repository). When we apply to a user purchasing a product, we will try to show five other products that the user is most likely to buy together with this product.<\/p> <p>*Madeleine Bonsma-Fisher* (and possibly some of her collaborators) will be talking about a graduate student-led participatory live-coding quantitative methods course in R.<\/p> <p>Doors will open at 6:00pm, with talks kicking off at 6:30. After the talks you're welcome to stick around for some networking, and by 8:00 we'll leave the room (but may head somewhere nearby to continue the conversation!).<\/p> <p>The event will be held at Insight Data Science, so please remember to thank them.<\/p> <p>By attending, you agree to abide by our code of conduct which can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a><\/p> ",

Pour un projet reproductible, les workflows peuvent être présentés dans un fichier Rmarkdown, combinant explications et analyses. Nous allons nous appuyer sur ce format Rmd pour s'assurer de la pérennité de nos travaux.<br/>Nous tenterons au passage de désacraliser la création de package. En continuant d'écrire notre code (presque) comme d'habitude mais en faisant les bons copier-coller au bon moment, on peut développer des analyses avec toute la documentation nécessaire sans (trop d')efforts. Le format package simplifie le partage, les tests, la maintenance et la présentation de son travail.<\/p> <p>Sébastien Rochette est formateur-consultant en R chez ThinkR.

    "description": "<p>Shiny in Production!<br/>Presented by Sean Lopp, RStudio<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R, a language not traditionally known for web frameworks, to say the least. As such, Shiny has always faced questions about whether it can or should be used “in production”. In this talk, we’ll explore what “production” even means, review some of the historical obstacles and objections to using Shiny for production purposes, and discuss practices and tools that can help your Shiny apps flourish.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Sean Lopp is a Product Manager at RStudio. Sean leads teams to create useful, enjoyable products. Before RStudio he was a data scientist and worked on alternative vehicle models at NREL, infant sleep dynamics, and originally studied mathematics. He lives outside Denver, CO and skis and bikes with his family.<\/p> <p>We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts.<\/p> <p>* Pizza will be provided by RStudio<br/>* Event location provided by WeWork<\/p> <p>WeWork is a global network of workspaces where companies grow together. Teams of any size can find refreshingly designed collaborative space, private offices, and meeting rooms that energize their employees and their guests. But WeWork is so much more than four walls—providing community, amenities, events, and technology to evolve space into experience.<\/p> ",

Containers allow software to be used in a reproducible, reliable and isolated fashion.<\/p> <p>Bioconductor also produces containers which replicate their build machines to allow developers contributing to the project to test their changes more aggressively before being put in production. These containers will provide the base infrastructure for cloud/web platforms in the near future.

Most business analysts are constrained by Excel to simplistic data visualization. We will review several techniques in R to automate tasks and produce colorful, engaging insights from the data you already have in Excel or business databases. This talk will be approachable for beginners and interesting for advanced R users as well. The code demonstrated will be shared via GitHub, and the packages we will review included aws, comprehend (NLP), pdftools &amp; officer (text scraping), dplyr &amp; ggplot, visNetwork (directed graphs), mongolite (MongoDB in the cloud), and Shiny.<\/p> <p>Andy will start his presentation at about 6:00.

The purpose of this event is to look back at the events we enjoyed last year, celebrate growth and diversity of our community and discuss the road ahead. We will have a few lightning talks (10-15 min) on diverse subjects and leave time for discussions and reflections on how UseR meetups helped you grow or learn in the last year.<\/p> <p>In order to ensure constant flow of fun and useful events, we need to have people organizing them and making sure speakers, venues and practicalities are taken care of in time for every new UseR meeting. We would like to elect Organizing Committee consisting of 5-6 members, who would take on responsibility to serve the community in the next 12 months. Here are some of the topics that Organizing Committee will assume responsibility for:<br/>1) Recruiting speakers for the events<br/>2) Arranging venues<br/>3) Applying for and arranging sponsor support for the group<br/>4) Keeping community informed through timely announcements and event marketing<br/>5) Maintaining relationship with partner organizations, such as R-Ladies, global UseR network, and other meetups in Oslo.<\/p> <p>Based on the experience from last year, these duties should not take more than 3-4 hours per month, but we want to avoid the situation where everyone assumes somebody else is taking care of a particular issue and in the end no one steps up to the responsibility.<\/p> <p>Acting as a Meetup Organizer goes beyond the line on the resume. It means meeting new people, expanding your network and talking to colleagues in senior positions in data community. You also make yourself known to the wider community of R users around the world, get inspired to pursue cool projects and interesting ideas and generally grow as an R programmer and a data professional.<\/p> <p>We are hereby inviting you to nominate yourself to a community service position at the Oslo UseR Organizing Committee! If you have been enjoying our meetups, now you have the chance to make sure others can enjoy them, too!<\/p> <p>Please, post your name and a couple of sentences describing your motivation for serving at the Oslo UseR Organizing Committee for the year 2019/2020 here:<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/messages/boards/thread/52386458/0/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/messages/boards/thread/52386458/0/<\/a><\/p> <p>Thank you very much for your dedication to spreading knowledge of R and your support for Oslo UseR community!<\/p> <p>On behalf of interim Organizer Committee,<\/p> <p>Dmytro<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Two separate topics for this meetup;<br/>Exploring Longitudinal data with the brolgar package<br/>Productionising models in AWS using SageMaker<\/p> <p>Thanks again to Servian for venue and catering!<\/p> <p>Rough agenda:<br/>5:45: Networking, food &amp; drinks<br/>6:15 First presentation<br/>7:00 Second presentation<br/>7:45 More networking<br/>8:30 Close<\/p> <p>First presentation: Making better spaghetti (plots): Exploring the individuals in longitudinal data with the brolgar package<\/p> <p>Longitudinal (panel) data provide the opportunity to examine temporal patterns of individuals, because measurements are collected on the same person at different, and often irregular, time points. The data is typically visualised using a \"spaghetti plot\", where a line plot is drawn for each individual. When overlaid in one plot, it can have the appearance of a bowl of spaghetti. With even a small number of subjects, these plots are too overloaded to be read easily. The interesting aspects of individual differences are lost in the noise.<\/p> <p>Longitudinal data is often modeled with a hierarchical linear model to capture the overall trends, and variation among individuals, while accounting for various levels of dependence. However, these models can be difficult to fit, and can miss unusual individual patterns. Better visual tools can help to diagnose longitudinal models, and better capture the individual experiences.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Nick will introduce the R package, **brolgar** (BRowse over Longitudinal data Graphically and Analytically in R), which provides tools to identify and summarise interesting individual patterns in longitudinal data.<\/p> <p>Dr. Nick Tierney completed his PhD in Statistics at QUT and is now a Lecturer at Monash University. Nick's research aims to improve data analysis workflow. This includes statistical modelling, calculating diagnostics, drawing inferences and making decisions. Crucial to this work is producing high quality software to accompany each research idea. His work so far has focussed on the importance of knowing your data ( in the R package, visdat ), and on creating principles and tools that make it easier to work with, explore, and model missing data (in the R package, naniar). Nick has also created an optimisation model that identifies and possibly relocates facilities to maximise their coverage on a population, in the R package maxcovr. Nick loves the R programming language and how it has transformed his world. He is a proud member of the rOpenSci community, a collective that works to make science open using R, and co-host a podcast with Dr. Saskia Freytag about everything #rstats named “Credibly Curious”.<\/p> <p>Second presentation: Building Scalable Production-Ready R model using AWS<\/p> <p>In this growing world of Machine Learning, we often roam around creating POCs (proof-of-concepts), but an important aspect that is often forgotten is how we bring models from POC and into production. The thing is, productionising your model and ensuring scalability is not as easy as a click of a button or minor code change. Even after you get your model into production, we must re-evaluate our model, perform A/B testing and redeploy our model. This is all part of the data science pipeline. All of these steps are time-consuming and require many configurational changes.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, Jeno will present how everyday data scientists can take the model they have built-in R, productionise it with the use of Docker and AWS SageMaker at ease. This will cover the training, deployment, A/B testing of the model you have built using R and some aspects of AWS and Docker.<\/p> <p>As a Consultant at Servian, Jeno has been helping various businesses build scalable data and cloud solutions in the areas of AI/ML, Data Warehousing, Data Migration, Serverless, and Containers. He holds a Master of Data Science degree from Monash University and is a lover for R. When he is not busy roaming around Medium on the latest tech and analysing and modeling in R, he competes in Hackathons and Datathons around Melbourne.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>For this meetup we have two separate presentations, the first on writing better R code, and the second on getting your colleagues started with R.<\/p> <p>We have a new host for this one - Betfair, who will also provide catering, many thanks!<\/p> <p>Rough agenda:<br/>5:45: Networking, food &amp; drinks<br/>6:15 First presentation<br/>7:00 Second presentation<br/>7:45 More networking<br/>8:30 Close<\/p> <p>First presentation: betteR - Learnings from an everyday pursuit of wanting to write better R code<\/p> <p>At any point in time, when I look back at my code from 6 months ago, I generally hate it and am able to say to myself that I'm glad I do this in a better manner. This is roughly my motto of continuous improvement and I'd like to share with the MelbURN community, a collection of learnings that I have acquired over the past few years. Whether it is following the DRY principle, or vowing to never write a for loop again, or learning to prepare recipes and bake them in R, a lot of things I have learnt have made me feel a lot better about how problems are tackled. Unlike other talks where you might learn about a particular package or technique, this talk will introduce you to some of the ways in which you can think about and be better at writing R code.<\/p> <p>Kaushik Lakshman is a data scientist and a massive fan of R. He works at Betfair where he uses R to analyse the incredibly rich and extensive betting exchange data, to create data products and create business value using data science. Outside of work he loves to have a go at building sports prediction models with the hope that one day it will help him retire at the beach (but has so far been very unsuccessful)!<\/p> <p>Second presentation: Getting your colleagues started with R<\/p> <p>R is fantastic piece of software which is widely used in academia and commercial sector – if you are coming to this talk then you are likely already a fan. In this presentation Lyndon will draw on his experience of teaching R to hundreds of academics and business professionals (and thousands of students) to discuss tips, tricks, and things to consider when introducing and teaching your colleagues how to use R. This will include different approaches to teaching and supporting colleagues, some useful tools and resources, and the different needs and support that your colleagues may require.<\/p> <p>Dr Lyndon Walker is a former statistics lecturer who is now a part-time statistician for SACS Consulting - a psychometrics and organisational psychology company, founder of Veritate Data Science - an education and statistics training consultancy, and investor/advisor to Preventure - a workplace safety wearable tech startup. He has used R for 22 years.<\/p> ",

On the opposite side of the spectrum, tools for automated data analysis promise to do everything with one click; in reality, they are often just a list of pre-compiled models, with huge variance in accuracy and interpretability.<\/p> <p>In this talk, we will try to find some middle ground by taking a fresh look at \"symbolic regression\", i.e. the idea that you can fit arbitrary datasets by evolving a population of mathematical expressions until you find something that fits data well enough. Instead of taking the standard optimization route provided by genetic algorithms, we will borrow ideas from probabilistic programming to build a small \"robot scientist\" with webPPL: if mathematics is a language, why can't we use ideas from natural language processing to explore the space of expressions?<\/p> <p>Agenda:<\/p> <p>5:50 pm - 6:00 pm Arrival and socializing<br/>6:00 pm - 6:10 pm Opening<br/>6:10 pm - 7:10 pm Jacopo Tagliabue, \"(Robot) Data Scientists as a Service\"<br/>7:10 pm - 7:30 pm Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>About Jacopo Tagliabue:<\/p> <p>Jacopo Tagliabue was co-founder and nerd in chief at Tooso - a Gartner “Cool Vendor” company that was acquired in 2019 by world search leader Coveo.

    "description": "<p>In the real world, training datasets are not as readily available as Kaggle would have you believe. In certain situations, they are extremely costly to obtain, while in others they are impossible. In this talk, I will describe two cases where we had to get creative to obtain training datasets. I want an argumentative environment where we can discuss our ideas.<\/p> <p>Record linkage is a classic problem in statistics and machine learning. There are two datasets, with several fields in common, but no unique identifiers as match keys. Due to a lack of ground truth training dataset, unsupervised learning techniques are usually employed. However, we embarked on an ambitious project to create a training dataset using unsupervised learning, and feed that to a machine learning model which then learned to make predictions of match or no match.<\/p> <p>In the second project, we had to extract handwritten information from checks. The hard part of the problem is recognizing fields like dates, signatures etc on a check. The costly way would be to have human raters mark each field with coordinates. However, we decided to create a fake training dataset where we automatically generated date fields (populated with handwritten dates) and used that to train a classifier that recognized real date fields on checks.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<\/p> <p>6:20 pm - 6:30 pm Arrival and socializing<br/>6:30 pm - 6:40 pm Opening words<br/>6:40 pm - 7:50 pm Ahmad Emad, \"Data Science Talk #1\"<br/>7:50 pm - 8:00 pm Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>About Ahmad Emad:<\/p> <p>Ahmad Emad is currently a Data Scientist at Google, where he applies experiment design and machine learning techniques to make Google Assistant more useful and user-friendly.

What would it mean in practice to apply data protection regulations to a model in this circumstance?<\/p> <p>In research connecting the development of statistical models and the regulatory frameworks that our work is done within, this month’s paper explores these questions and looks at what lessons we can draw from this exercise.<\/p> <p>The main body of the discussion will be around the paper below<\/p> <p>- Paper - Algorithms that remember: model inversion attacks and data protection law - Veale, Binns, Edwards (2018)<br/>- <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04644.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04644.pdf<\/a><\/p> <p>There is also a blog by one of the authors which summarises the issues<\/p> <p>- Blog - <a href=\"https://ai-auditingframework.blogspot.com/2019/09/privacy-attacks-on-ai-models.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://ai-auditingframework.blogspot.com/2019/09/privacy-attacks-on-ai-models.html<\/a><\/p> <p>Further materials (not necessary for the discussion, but go into more technical aspects of how these attacks might work)<\/p> <p>- Video on Membership Inference attacks - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDm1n2gceJY\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDm1n2gceJY<\/a><br/>- Paper on Model Inversion attack - <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfredrik/papers/fjr2015ccs.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfredrik/papers/fjr2015ccs.pdf<\/a><\/p> <p>—<\/p> <p>A note about the Journal Club format:<\/p> <p>1. The sessions usually start with a 5-10 minute introduction to the paper by the topic volunteer, followed by splitting into smaller groups to discuss the paper and other materials. We finish the session by coming together for about 15 minutes to discuss what we have learned as a group and ask questions around the room.<br/>2. There is no speaker at Journal Club. One of the community has volunteered their time to suggest the topic and start the session, but most of the discussion comes from within the groups.<br/>3. You will get more benefit from the session if you read the paper or other materials in advance. We try to provide (where we can find them) accompanying blog posts, relevant code and other summaries of the topic to serve as entry points.<br/>4. If you don't have time to do much preparation, please come anyway. You will probably have something to contribute, and even if you just end up following the other discussions, you can still learn a lot.<br/>5. It's OK just to read the blog post or watch the video :)<br/>6. We don't have spare copies of the paper during the session, so please print out your own if you want a hard copy for discussion. For digital copies, you are welcome to use your laptops/tablets/phones during the session.<\/p> ",

Introduction / Networking<\/p> <p>3:00 P.M. - 3:50 P.M. Session 1<\/p> <p>Title: A Scalable Artificial Intelligence Data Pipeline for Accelerating Time to Insight<\/p> <p>Speaker: Dr. Sanhita Sarkar, Global Director, Analytics Software Development, Western Digital<\/p> <p>Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) requires processing power and adequate storage while executing various deep learning (DL) frameworks. The training and deployment stages of a DL system have different data and processing needs. On one hand, the large volumes of data during<br/>training demands systems with support for massive storage capacity, multiple data formats and protocols for processing dispersed data sets, and sharing of data and models across applications. On the other hand, AI deployment for delivering inference on incoming data requires fast access to the data to meet the demand for AI responsiveness for applications.<\/p> <p>The processing and storage needs vary for the different phases of an AI data pipeline comprising of data ingestion, model training and model serving. Disaggregation of GPUs, flash and object storage can enable the delivery of rapid response times and scaling requirements of an AI data pipeline, without compromising on data persistence, quality, durability and cost.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio: Sanhita Sarkar is a Global Director, Analytics Software Development at Western Digital, where she oversees software design and development of analytical features and solutions from edge to data center/cloud. She focuses on key vertical markets such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Defense and Intelligence, Media and Entertainment, and Genomics and Healthcare.

Please join us as Rinu Fasehun, Senior Data Scientist at USAA, gives a talk on “Why Data Science cannot ignore Statistics”.<\/p> <p>Statistics is the science of data and statistical methods are a key part of data science, yet a lot of data scientists’ misconceptions regarding statistics involve coding algorithms without learning the prerequisites. With the rise of big data, citizen data scientists, and tools allowing for easy implementation of powerful machine learning algorithms, it’s worth asking if statistical concerns are being overlooked. Using examples, I will discuss how statistics and statistical methods play a key role in data science. I will illustrate the most common types of statistical mistakes in the data science process that people in the field tend to make.<\/p> <p> Bias/ Sampling<br/> Exploratory data analysis<br/> Feature engineering<br/> Simpson’s Paradox<br/> Coding algorithms without knowing what goes on under the hood<\/p> <p>Prior to joining USAA as a senior data scientist, Rinu worked as an Analytic Consultant in the Life and Health Services industry where she was responsible for developing statistical models for health outcomes, call center optimization techniques and disease management program evaluations.<br/>Rinu holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Statistics and a Masters of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Lagos, Nigeria and a Masters degree in Statistics from Columbia University New York.<\/p> <p>This event will also be YouTube streamed at: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1G0D2WBnVaw\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/1G0D2WBnVaw<\/a><\/p> ",

Below you can find more information about the talk and how to submit your lightning talk proposal.<\/p> <p>MLOps by Hossein Sarshar<\/p> <p>MLOps, is a set of tools, processes and more importantly mindsets to resolve these issues by making the ML life cycle more transparent. These include building collaborative dev environments to make reproducible, trackable and testable experiments. In addition, it helps the data science teams to work within the application development lifecycle, therefore, they are aware of the requirements of the upstream systems and how their model will be integrated with a broader application.

Previously, she was a data scientist at Rue Gilt Groupe, incorporating data science and machine learning in retail space to drive revenue and enhance personalized shopping experiences of customers. She earned her Ph.D. degree in computer science at Boston University.<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>With the recent popularity of machine learning algorithms such as neural networks and ensemble methods, etc., machine learning models become more like a ‘black box’, harder to understand and interpret. To gain the user’s trust, there is a strong need to develop tools and methodologies to help the user to understand and explain how predictions are made. Data scientists also need to have the necessary insights to learn how the model can be improved. Much research has gone into model interpretability and recently several open sources tools, including LIME, SHAP, and GAMs, etc., have been published on GitHub. In this talk, we present popular state-of-the-art interpretability algorithms and introduce a Machine Learning Interpretability toolkit which incorporates the cutting-edge technologies in the domain of AI transparency. Using this toolkit, data scientists can explain machine learning models using state-of-art technologies in an easy-to-use and scalable fashion.<\/p> <p>ODSC Links:<br/>• Get free access to more talks like this at LearnAI:<br/><a href=\"https://learnai.odsc.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://learnai.odsc.com/<\/a><br/>• Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI/<\/a><br/>• Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odsc\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/odsc<\/a> &amp; @odsc<br/>• LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science/<\/a><br/>• West Conference Oct 29 - Nov 1: <a href=\"https://odsc.com/california\" class=\"linkified\">https://odsc.com/california<\/a><br/>• Europe Conference Nov 19 - 22: <a href=\"https://odsc.com/london\" class=\"linkified\">https://odsc.com/london<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>🆂🅻🅾🆃 #1: Get to Know Firebase and its ML Kit - Rachel Saunders, Google<\/p> <p>Firebase enables app developers to build faster and easier with serverless products (like authentication and real-time databases). The Firebase platform can also help with app quality (like Crashlytics) and growing your app (like sliced audience feature distribution and messaging). Both prototype and production apps can take advantage of our toolkits for developing and growing your app. Come learn about how Firebase can help you with your hobby, startup, or even enterprise-level apps!<\/p> <p>We'll also take a bit of deep dive into ML Kit - Firebase's mobile SDK that offers you Google's machine learning in a powerful yet easy-to-use package. There's no need to have deep knowledge of neural networks or model optimization to get started. On the other hand, if you are an experienced ML developer, ML Kit provides convenient APIs that help you use your custom TensorFlow Lite models in your mobile apps.<\/p> <p>🆂🅻🅾🆃 #2: MLKit + Firebase Predictions - Aditya Gautam, Google<\/p> <p>ML Kit allows you to harness the power of machine learning in your apps without needing to be an expert. Leverage powerful, but simple-to-use on-device and cloud-based APIs for Vision and Natural Language Processing, or train and/or deploy your own models. Understand some big additions to ML Kit and how to use these to enable smarter, richer experiences to your users. In the second half, we would learn about how we can do smart segmentation of users using Firebase Predictions and target the selected groups of people for revenue optimization, user retention and other customization.<\/p> <p>🆂🅻🅾🆃 #3: BigQuery ML: Practical use cases using the built in machine learning algorithm in BigQuery - Marcus Stade<\/p> <p>Creating machine learning models directly in the Cloud Data Warehouse? Big Query, part of the Google Cloud Platform, offers a integrated solution called Big Query ML with the possibility to create machine learning models and make prediction based on data stored in the database. The build-in machine learning solution offers a wide variety of machine learning models types, e.g linear regression, logistic regression and k-means clustering. In this presentation we will create machine learning models and make predictions based on business data.<\/p> <p>Marcus has a track record as digital analytics consultant. Before joining the digital analytics community, he was working in the field of Web-Development and Online-Marketing. He organizes the Digital Analytics Meetup in Munich and Nuremberg and publishes articles covering Digital Analytics topics on magazines and his blog <a href=\"https://www.marcusstade.de\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.marcusstade.de<\/a>­.<\/p> <p>We are looking for speakers and sponsors!<\/p> <p>As always, we are super happy to have you with a lightning talk on your small or big successes, open source projects or just something amazing you would like to share.<\/p> <p>Do not miss out updates on twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hack_ai\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/hack_ai<\/a> and join Munich ML community on Slack channel <a href=\"https://ai-hack-inviter.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://ai-hack-inviter.herokuapp.com/<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>During the training and development cycle of a machine learning model, the interpretability of model outputs is essential to verify hypotheses and build trust with stakeholders. However, what methods exist to interpret models? And is the application of these methods limited to the model development process?<\/p> <p>Moreover, after deploying a machine learning model inference data can change relative to training data. This is one of the main reasons contributing to degraded model performance over time. But what causes this to occur? And how do you verify a model's robustness after deployment?<\/p> <p>This meetup will focus on the topic of data drift and model interpretability. It will aim to answer the questions above with a balance between theory and practice, and explore how Microsoft Azure can help tackle these issues.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<\/p> <p>Nicholas has worked in several technical roles spanning finance, government and technology. He is currently a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft specializing in Data and AI. His professional interests include everything related to technology, artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing.<\/p> ",

Doors will open at 5:30PM where members can enjoy pizza, soda, and networking. The first talk will begin at 6:00PM. Included below are brief summaries of the topics covered in this meetup. If you would like to read more about the speakers, view future events, or contact us please visit our site:<br/><a href=\"https://imstatsbee.github.io/calgaryr/meetings1920.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://imstatsbee.github.io/calgaryr/meetings1920.html<\/a><\/p> <p>Talk 1: Cybera’s tools and programs in support of data science in Alberta by David Chan<\/p> <p>An overview will be provided of the tools and projects Cybera - an Alberta based not-for-profit organization - makes available to folks interested in data science, including members of the CalgaryR group. Tools include our free general purpose Infrastructure as a Service environment, which also provides access to GPU resources. Recent results and plans to support K-12, entrepreneurs, and budding data scientists in Alberta through our Callysto and Data Science for Albertans projects will also be presented. Lastly, we seek input from CalgaryR members on a tool that the team has been working on, which strives to apply best practices from the software development world to data science projects through a structured framework. This will include a brief demo and overview of a roadmap of challenges we hope to address with the tool.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Practical Applications of Text Analysis / Natural Language Processing by Naoko Tomioka<\/p> <p>The field of text analysis is constantly evolving, and new tools and algorithms become available on a regular basis. Text analytic tools and packages range from low-level processing tools, such as tokenizer and entity extraction, to higher-level processing such as sentiment analysis and text classification. The applicability of each tool depends on the type of the data to be analysed and the intended use of the output. I will talk about several of my own projects in order to illustrate the process of selecting the best tools, and what text analysis looks like in a business context.<\/p> <p>Talk 3: Community Development - Calgary Artificial Intelligence Meetup by Drew Gilson<\/p> <p>Drew Gillson is a technologist, entrepreneur, and community leader. In addition to organizing the Calgary Artificial Intelligence Meetup, Drew works for Looker, a data analytics software company that is being acquired by Google. Drew has been an active member of the Calgary innovation ecosystem since the dark ages of 2001.

    "start": "2019-10-02",
    "description": "<p>¡Te invitamos a nuestro próximo meetup de lujo que co-organizamos con WiMLDS Buenos Aires!<\/p> <p>En esta ocasión nos visita Erin LeDell, co-fundadora de R-Ladies y fundadora WiMLDS. Erin nos dará una charla sobre Scalable Automatic Machine Learning con H2O (en inglés). ¿De qué se trata esto?<\/p> <p>* H2O es una plataforma distribuida de aprendizaje automático de código abierto diseñada para big data. Los algoritmos principales de aprendizaje automático de H2O se implementan en Java de alto rendimiento, sin embargo, las API con todas las funciones están disponibles en R, Python, Scala, REST/JSON, y también a través de una interfaz web. Dado que las implementaciones de algoritmos de H2O se distribuyen, esto permite que el software escale a conjuntos de datos muy grandes -que superan la RAM en una sola máquina-. H2O actualmente presenta implementaciones distribuidas de modelos lineales generalizados, Gradient Boosting Machines, Random Forest, Deep Neural Nets, Stacked Ensembles (aka \"Super Learners\"), métodos de reducción de dimensionalidad (PCA, GLRM), clusterización (K-means), detección de anomalías, etc.<\/p> <p>* H2O AutoML proporciona una interfaz fácil de usar que automatiza el pre-procesamiento de datos, el entrenamiento y el ajuste de una gran selección de modelos candidatos (incluidos múltiples modelos de conjuntos apilados para un rendimiento superior) y, debido a la naturaleza distribuida de la plataforma de H2O, H2O AutoML puede escalar a conjuntos de datos muy grandes. El resultado de la ejecución de H2O AutoML es una \"tabla de clasificación\" de modelos fácilmente exportable para su uso en producción. Ejemplos de código en R y en Python estarán disponibles en GitHub para que les participantes puedan seguirlos en sus laptops (de todos modos, no es necesario que traigas tu laptop!).<\/p> <p>A lo largo de la charla, entonces, contarás con una breve descripción del campo del aprendizaje automático, seguida de una mirada detallada dentro del algoritmo AutoML de H2O.<\/p> <p>¿Te parece que este meetup no es para vos? Creemos que es una oportunidad única para conocer e interactuar con una de las mejores investigadoras de su disciplina en un ambiente relajado, amigable e inclusivo.<\/p> <p>¿El inglés te saca las ganas? Si querés hacerle alguna pregunta a Erin las organizadoras podemos ayudar.<\/p> <p>¡Ojalá te sumes! Además de la charla de Erin, vas a podér conocer más sobre R-Ladies y WiMLDS. También habrá tiempo para hacer sociales y nuevas conexiones.<\/p> <p>Nuestro compromiso: te vas a sentir muy bien y le vamos a poner la buena onda de siempre.<\/p> <p>En esta ocasión nos recibe generosamente Telecom quien también nos ofrecerá un rico catering acorde con esta ocasión tan especial.<\/p> <p>¡Nos vemos!<\/p> ",

Food and drinks afterwards.<\/p> <p>Presentations<\/p> <p>1) Hayley Tumas - Genetics the “R”ight way<br/>Decades of habitat destruction, increasing species extinction rate, and climate change have motivated ecosystem restoration efforts on a global scale. Genetic diversity is key for creating healthy and resilient populations, meaning genetic analyses are critical for informing effective ecosystem restoration. The size of genetic data, especially with recent advances, and complexity of analyses requires specialized software. In the past, analyses have required multiple software programs with different user interfaces and data formats. R has not only made genetic analyses more streamlined and straight forward, but has also increased reproducibility and provided the opportunity for more innovative approaches. From data management to data visualization and publication, R is the future for genetic analysis in conservation sciences and across other disciplines.<\/p> <p>2) David Selby - Modelling research funding with R<\/p> <p>The location of the meetup is room MUIR-112, Muirhead Tower, University of Birmingham campus (B15 2TN). The building is just off Pritchatts Road, which is a short walk from the train station (called University) or bus stop (busses X20/21/22, stop University North Gate).

    "description": "<p>**Note: This is one of two events happening this month for our Northside-Southside double header, one in Hyde Park on 9/24, and another in Evanston on 9/26. Choose one or attend both!**<\/p> <p>Dr. Leah Welty will present: \"Collaborative Reproducibility: Connecting R/R Markdown and Microsoft Word using StatTag\"<\/p> <p>Although R Markdown can render documents to Microsoft Word, R/R Markdown users must sometimes transcribe statistical content in to separate Microsoft Word documents (e.g., documents drafted by colleagues in Word, or documents that must be prepared in Word), a process that is error prone, irreproducible, and inefficient. We will present StatTag (www.stattag.org), an open source, free, and user-friendly program we developed to address this problem. StatTag establishes a bi-directional link between R/RMarkdown files and a Word document, and supports a reproducible pipeline even when: (1) statistical results must be included and updated in Word documents that were never generated from Markdown; and (2) text in Word files generated from R/RMarkdown has departed substantially from original Markdown content, for example through tracked changes or comments. We will demonstrate how to use StatTag to connect R/RMarkdown and Word files so that all files can be edited separately, but statistical content –values, tables, figures, and verbatim output– can be updated automatically in Word. Using practical examples, we will also illustrate how to use StatTag to view, edit, and rerun R/RMarkdown code directly from Word. The talk will also include an overview of reproducible research in the collaborative research.<\/p> <p>About the Speaker<br/>Leah J. Welty, PhD is Professor in the Division of Biostatistics, Department of Preventive Medicine and in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and is the Director of the Biostatistics Collaboration Center within the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. She is also the Immediate Past President of the Association of Clinical and Translational Statisticians. She earned her PhD in statistics from the University of Chicago, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. Her research interests include longitudinal and multilevel models, psychiatric epidemiology, and the development of reproducible research tools for clinical and translational science. She is the lead biostatistician for the Northwestern Juvenile Project, a large-scale longitudinal study of psychiatric disorders and risky behaviors in delinquent youth. She has led the development of StatTag, a free, open-source program to support reproducible research in clinical and translational science.<\/p> <p>Schedule<br/>4:30-5pm - Food, Intros &amp; Announcements<br/>5-6pm - StatTag<br/>6-6:30pm - Socializing/Networking<\/p> <p>**This event is child-friendly!<br/>We realize this is an earlier start time than our normal events and strive to make it accessible to all.

Please arrive at 5:45pm for a 6pm start.<\/p> <p>The lecture will be followed by the Belz Dinner at 7:30pm. This will be at University House at the Woodward, on Level 10 of the same building as the lecture. Please book your spot for the dinner here: <a href=\"https://statsoc.org.au/event-3527803\" class=\"linkified\">https://statsoc.org.au/event-3527803<\/a><\/p> <p>Statistics is the Crown Jewel of Data Science<\/p> <p>Antony Ugoni (Director, Global Matching and Analytics, SEEK)<\/p> <p>Statistics has always been vitally important to Data Science, and its importance is growing. With data scientists in critically short supply, however, the discipline is attracting talented people from many different disciplines, each bringing different and complementary skills to a data science team.<\/p> <p>Integral to such a team's work involves tasks that are standard fare in statistics. Examples include statistical inference, experimental design, or supporting decision making under uncertainty. Powerful approaches to these are well known to experienced statisticians but not necessarily to many data scientists. What are some of these?<\/p> <p>Antony will share stories from his work leading data science teams in industry, illustrating examples where statistics has worked its magic. He will urge us to renew the wonder and amazement of our discipline as the best way to force our discipline to take its rightful place in the Data Science discipline, and inspire the statistics profession to pass this on to the new generation of data scientists.<\/p> <p>Biography:<\/p> <p>Antony is one of Australia’s leaders in analytics and in 2013 accepted an opportunity at SEEK to develop the analytics capability.<\/p> <p>Antony began his career as a Biostatistician to the Alfred Group of Hospitals jointly with Monash Medical School. He then moved to a lecturing role in Biostatistics at the University of Melbourne. Antony has co-authored more than 50 peer reviewed articles in medical research and still actively contributes to this industry today.<\/p> <p>From 2000 to 2013 Antony worked at National Australia Bank leading many ground breaking teams and projects. Antony started as the lead for its Credit Card Fraud Analytics Group which used data driven insights to reduce fraud losses by more than 50% in a market that was experiencing fraud losses growing at 30% per annum. Antony was then offered the opportunity to lead the Customer Analytics team which, in his tenure, identified more than $100b worth of revenue opportunities.<\/p> <p>Since 2013 Antony has worked at the Seek Group and founded the team that today is known as AI Platform Services. The AI Platform Services team are responsible for utilising the data captured by Seek assets to build services that help great candidates find jobs and stand out from the crowd, and hirers to identify great candidates in a timely fashion. Today the team numbers more than 100 Data Scientists, Data Engineers and Strategists, delivering services in 19 markets across the world, reaching 2.9 Billion candidates.<\/p> <p>Antony:<br/>* holds a BSc(Hons) and an MSc from La Trobe University,<br/>* is the Chairman of IAPA (The Institute of Analytics Professionals, Australia),<br/>* is a Board Member of AADL (The Australian Alliance for Data Leadership),<br/>* is a Board Member of ADMA (The Association for Data-Driven Marketing and Advertising),<br/>* is an Advisory Board member of the analytics start-up Pascal51, and<br/>* is an Advisory Board member for the Centre of Business Analytics, Melbourne Business School<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>\"Transitioning into the tidyverse\"<\/p> <p>• Description:<br/>Most people who learned R before the tidyverse have likely started to feel a nibble of pressure to get aboard the tidyverse train. Sadly a fact of human nature is that once you’re comfortable doing something a certain way, it’s hard to find the motivation to learn a different way of doing something that you already know how to do. While the tidyverse is primarily made up of a set of super useful R packages (ggplot2, dplyr, purrr, tidyr, readr, tibble), it is also a way of thinking about implementing “tidy” data analysis. If you combine tidy thinking with the tidy packages, you will inevitably become a master of tidy analysis. This talk will provide a guide for easing into the tidyverse for new users by first focusing on piping, dplyr, and ggplot2, and then providing short summaries and references for the remaining packages that form the tidyverse (and how they play together). Additional resources for continuing your tidyverse journey will be provided.<\/p> <p>• Target audience:<br/>People familiar with base R who want to familiarize themselves with the tidyverse, as well as those who have a little experience with the tidyverse and want a big picture of how it all fits together.<\/p> <p>The talk will be a combination of slides and live-coding, and is based on my two-part blog post on the tidyverse: <a href=\"http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse/<\/a> and <a href=\"http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.rebeccabarter.com/blog/2019-08-05_base_r_to_tidyverse_pt2/<\/a><\/p> <p>• Bio:<br/>Rebecca is a Statistics PhD Student at UC Berkeley as well as a Data Science Fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS). Her dual passions are explaining “seemingly complicated” concepts to others in plain English, and exploring and presenting the stories that underlie complex datasets. She has dabbled in writing software as the author of the superheat R package for creating beautiful and customizable heatmaps in R. Rebecca also writes blog posts about R and statistics over at her website, www.rebeccabarter.com. When she's not doing R or stats stuff, she can usually be found climbing rocks somewhere, taking photos of beautiful places, or throwing wonky mugs and bowls at the pottery studio!<\/p> <p>================================================<br/>AGENDA:<br/>5:30pm - 6pm: Help with the setup (install R packages and anything else that is needed for the workshop)<br/>6pm - 6:30pm: Networking<br/>6:30pm - 7:45pm: Workshop<br/>7:45pm - 8pm: Networking<\/p> <p>================================================<br/>• Important to know<br/>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>Anyone who violates or has previously violated this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, meetup membership or other condition.<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a><\/p> <p>• The mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community.<\/p> <p>We are emphatically queer and trans-friendly.<\/p> <p>• Refreshments and food will be provided.<\/p> <p>A huge thank you to Sojern (<a href=\"https://www.sojern.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sojern.com/<\/a>) for hosting us!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>We are super pleased to invite you to our workshop \"Introduction to Bayesian Statistical Modelling using brms\". In this two-day workshop, we will learn some basics about Bayesian statistics, with a focus on using a Bayesian approach to statistical modelling. We will use brms package by Paul Bürkner, which uses Stan.<\/p> <p>On the first day, we will have an intro to Bayesian statistics and statistical modelling. We will be introduced to brms using simple variants of the general linear model, and multi-level models, with a normal response distribution.<\/p> <p>On the second day, we will take a look at the binomial and Poisson distribution for count data, and learn when we should used them and how to do so using brms.<\/p> <p>The workshop will have small lectures and some practical exercises so the participants can fit their own models with brms.<\/p> <p>This workshop will be facilitated by Marie Beisemann. She's about to start her Phd in Statistics at the Technical University of Dortmund, Germany, right after finishing he Master's degree in psychology at the University of Münster. She's (really) passionate about sharing her knowledge about brms and Bayes with us, and we're super excited to have her here!<\/p> <p>P. S., if you will attend this workshop, we really need you to install brms beforehand.<\/p> ",

Come and meet us because we have two speakers excited to share their research about the application of Big Data and Machine Learning in their respective field.<\/p> <p>Our first speaker is Joji Teves, a current Ph.D. fellow at the University of Copenhagen – iMED program. As a trained cellular biologist in a computational biology group, Joji is currently exploring big data tools to map out genomic marks of healthy and diseased cell states. Prior to moving to Copenhagen, Joji earned her Master’s at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, USA where she studied Patient-derived biospecimens from Parkinson’s disease patients and studied cellular marks related to cellular autophagy and UV damage in comparison to healthy age-match cohorts. As a “data science” noob, she takes on a different perspective on how data science tools can be applied in biology to study health and diseases.<\/p> <p>Our second speaker is Jhaz Petersen - a data-savvy Marketer who is a Graduate from Copenhagen Business School. She studied the traditional research methodologies but wanted to challenge that with the current technologies available. Therefore, she applies Machine Learning Algorithms in analyzing Big Data to solve Sales and Marketing case problems. She would like to share her original framework on how businesses in every industry can leverage their existing big data to create a business strategy.<\/p> <p>Program:<br/>17:00 - 17:15 Welcome<br/>17:15 - 17:35 Presentation by Joji Marie Teves - \"Exploring Computational<br/>Biology to study Cellular Health and Disease\"<br/>17:35 - 17:45 BREAK<br/>17:45 - 18:05 Presentation by Jhaz Petersen - \"Leveraging Big Data and Machine Learning in Sales &amp; Marketing - Application of Market Basket Analysis, Clustering &amp; 3D Customer Segmentation in R\"<br/>18:05 - 18:30 Closing and Networking<\/p> <p>Coffee and snacks will be served.<\/p> <p>Stay tuned for more details.<\/p> <p>*New info: If you are interested to learn the codes, I can share it after the presentation.

Here is the second of our September events!<\/p> <p>For our second event this month, we welcome Alison Hill, who will give a seminar about plots and how to improve them.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Alison will talk about one plot’s life cycle, from a sad Powerpoint slide to an Excel chart and finally to the finished product made with the ggplot2 package in R. Along the way, she will discuss why each version of the plot fails in different ways and how each iteration improved on the last one.<\/p> <p>Alison is a data scientist &amp; professional educator at RStudio, where she works to help people learn and use programming to do better work in less time, with less friction, and (perhaps) more joy. She loves working with data scientists across the spectrum- from beginners to advanced users- and particularly enjoy using software tools to create educational materials that enlighten and engage learners. Topics Alison teaches range from literate programming to machine learning. Her teaching materials have been used by NASA, Pew Research Center, University of Oregon, and now RStudio.<\/p> <p>This event will be hosted by our fantastic sponsor Nous. Pizza and drinks will be supplied for the evening. Arrive any time from 6.15 pm for a 6.30 pm start.<\/p> <p>See you all there!<\/p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne<\/p> ",

Russ has been a bioinformatician at the University of Glasgow's Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre for the past 4 years, studying gene regulation in chronic myeloid leukaemia. R is his go-to tool for data analysis / visualisation / reporting, and he started coding in R about 10 years ago (alongside perl / python etc). Find him on twitter as @haematobot and on github as @russHyde.<\/p> <p>Martin Anderson will be walking us through his R work in ‘Using social network analysis in a realist evaluation of a recovery enterprise’<br/>– describing a procedure for collecting ego-network data using participatory mapping methods and using R to code and analyse this data. Martin is a PhD student at the Social and Public Health Sciences Unit. His PhD research is an evaluation of the implementation of the San Patrignano recovery enterprise model in Scotland, seeking to understand the influence of contextual factors on change mechanisms when transferring an intervention model to a substantially different setting.<\/p> <p>Come along to hear our two speakers.

You can obviously use whatever techniques you feel are appropriate, but the data will be organized in a way that tidyverse tools will work well!<\/p> <p>We will come together and work in teams helping each other solve this weeks TidyTuesday challenge. TidyTuesdays are a great way to improve R skills and get involved in the community!<\/p> <p>* To participate in TidyTuesday, you need to do a few things *<\/p> <p>Create and save an image of a plot from R<br/>- Save the code used to recreate your plot (include data tidy steps!)<br/>- Submit the plot and code on Twitter<br/>- Use the #TidyTuesday hashtag (you can also tag me @thomas_mock)<br/>- Browse other submissions and like/comment on their work!<\/p> <p>However, that might seem like a lot! So at minimum please submit your plot with the hashtag #TidyTuesday.<\/p> <p>* Rules for TidyTuesday *<\/p> <p>We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts to participate, but be mindful of a few things:<\/p> <p>- This is NOT about criticizing the original authors. They are people like you and me and they have feelings. Focus on the data, the charts and improving your own techniques.<br/>- This is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow #RStats practitioners! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like other’s posts and help promote the #RStats community!<br/>- The data set comes from the source article or the source that the article credits. Be mindful that the data is what it is and Tidy Tuesday is designed to help you practice data visualization and basic data wrangling.<br/>- Use the hashtag #TidyTuesday on Twitter if you create your own version and would like to share it.<br/>- Include a picture of the visualisation when you post to Twitter.<br/>- Include a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to Twitter. Comment your code wherever possible to help yourself and others understand your process!<br/>- Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with someting simple! - Make something quick, but purposeful!<br/>- Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.<\/p> ",

At this meetup, the focus will be on practical knowledge over theoretical lectures, industrial solutions in code over mathematical formulas and real-life problems over synthetic ones. At every meetup, we will try our best to share take away scripts either through GitHub or Google Colab, so that you are able to re-run them at your convenience in your own time.<br/>Generally, the agenda will involve two presentations, networking over food and drinks and an open discussion.<br/>All are welcome – we look forward to hearing your perspective, experiences and sharing some knowledge and ideas!<\/p> <p>----<\/p> <p>For our inaugural event, we present:<\/p> <p>GEOFFREY PIDCOCK – “The ABC's of NLP”<\/p> <p>JAY YUAN – “Building ETL pipelines using AWS Glue”<\/p> <p>----<\/p> <p>GEOFFREY PIDCOCK, Senior Data Analyst at Atlassian – “The ABC's of NLP”<\/p> <p>Abstract - Someone has just handed you a heap of text to derive insights from or train your models on - now what? The field of natural language processing (NLP) provides a vast array of tools and approaches - the trick is knowing which one to apply given the specifics of your problem. This talk will provide a gentle introduction to NLP, and an overview of common use cases and benchmarks.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio - Geoff Pidcock uses data to drive impact and change within organisations. Trained as a Materials Scientist, Geoff moved into business and then data, leading the marketing data team at Salesforce, the data and analytics function at Jayride, and now using data to improve the customer experience at Atlassian. Geoff loves hiking and coding through Random Forests, and has a solid track record driving return on investments from data projects.<\/p> <p>----<\/p> <p>JAY YUAN, Data Scientist at CoreLogic Australia – “Building ETL pipelines using AWS Glue”<\/p> <p>Abstract - As Cloud Computing has become ubiquitous for gathering data, running ML algorithms and performing predictive analytics, data professionals today are striving more and more to utilize cloud services to set up the most robust, scalable data pipelines at cheap costs. Amazon’s AWS Glue and Athena help construct such serverless pipelines. Through this talk, Jay will be talking about AWS Glue, where it’s from, it’s use case and best practices for AWS Glue and Athena.<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio - Jay works as a Data Scientist at Corelogic Australia where his work is mainly focused on analytical products within the property domain such as Hedonic Index and Market Trends. He has previously worked at Equifax for debt recovery analytics.

The Meetup starts on 28th September and is a one day event.<br/>This Meetup is part of the Face Recognition Conference and an incredible chance to connect with both organizers, and individuals like you.<\/p> <p>Face recognition in static images and video sequences captured in unconstrained recording conditions is one of the most widely studied topics in computer vision due to its extensive applications in surveillance, law enforcement, bio-metrics, marketing, and so forth. Recently, methodologies that achieve good performance have been presented in top-tier computer vision conferences (e.g., ICCV, CVPR, ECCV etc.) and great progress has been achieved in face recognition with deep learning-based methods. Even though comprehensive benchmarks and extensive efforts exist for deep face recognition, very limited effort has been made towards benchmarking lightweight deep face recognition, which aims at model compactness and energy efficiency to enable efficient system deployment. In ICCV 2019, we make a significant step further and propose a new comprehensive benchmark, as well as organize the first challenge &amp; meetup for lightweight deep face recognition.<\/p> <p>Goal:<br/>Understand what AI is and it's applications in Face Recognition.<\/p> <p>What you'll learn:<br/>How to plan your career in Artificial Intelligence?<br/>Career path in Artificial Intelligence.<br/>Understanding Face Recognition and it's applications in day to day life.<\/p> <p>Ideal for:<br/>Anyone looking for career transformation and career guidance<br/>Who are interested in Artificial Intelligence?<br/>Graduates/Employees looking for upgrading skills<\/p> <p>Objectives of the Meetup:<br/>Understanding what Artificial Intelligence is<br/>Applications of AI in in different domains<br/>Understanding Face Recognition<br/>Applications of Face Recognition<\/p> ",

As most analyses require complete data, what to do with the missing values?<\/p> <p>An often used and easy solution to handle missing data is deleting incomplete rows and/or columns from the dataset. Is this method the most appropriate one, though? What other methods are available and what is their influence on the outcome of the analysis?<\/p> <p>The workshop has the following three parts.<br/>1. Missing Values Analysis<br/>What amount and what kind of missing data do I have in my dataset? What are possible reasons/mechanisms underlying the missingness?<br/>2.

When I studied Methodology and Statistics, I co-developed a procedure to generate missing data in complete datasets. I implemented the procedure in R-function ampute, and it is now part of imputation package mice.<\/p> <p>Then, I worked as an external PhD candidate under supervision of dr. Gerko Vink and prof. dr. Stef van Buuren. My work focused on the effect of missing data on prediction oriented analyses. Unfortunately, I had to quit with my research when I changed jobs and no more funding was available.<\/p> <p>Now, I work at Samen Veilig Midden-Nederland (i.e. a youth care organization) as Developer Data &amp; Analytics. It is my job to structure and standardize the analyses of sensitive and highly classified data. I mainly work with databases and visualization software and I lead several projects.<\/p> <p>REQUIREMENTS<br/>------------------------<br/>A basic knowledge of R is required.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct.

    "description": "<p>Literate Projecting<\/p> <p>\"Literate programming\" is an approach to writing software programs that weaves together the source code and documentation at the time of creation. The idea is to create programs that are easier for users to understand. But they are also easier for programmers to work on and maintain. In this talk, I will describe how data scientists can be inspired by this programming approach and start what I refer to as \"literate projecting.\" Literate projects are not only more pleasant to work on -- they are also easier for others to discover and explore. In my experiences as a researcher and now a data scientist at RStudio, I've had the pleasure to work on many literate projects, and I've felt the pain of working on illiterate ones too. What is the difference? What are the benefits? Based on my experiences, I'll share good literate projecting practices that have the potential to shift your mindset and reshape your workflow.<\/p> <p>Biography<\/p> <p>Alison Hill is a Data Scientist &amp; Professional Educator on the RStudio Education team, whose mission is to train the next million R users globally.

Arriving in Scotland 20 years ago, he initially worked as a research scientist in marine ecology. 10 years ago, he formally took on the job as data manager, and have since worked on opening up data and information about the Scottish Seas, improving the way in which data are stored, organised and published. He also collaborates with colleagues across the UK and Internationally through membership of various executive, advisory and expert groups on marine data management. But he also still dives into code, ancient paper records, and the occasional trip out to sea to collect more data.<\/p> <p>Talk Description: Have you ever tried to calculate the number of earth worms in your back garden using only a tea spoon? The task is not too dissimilar from what scientist need to do to quantify the number of fish we can catch to put on our plates, while ensuring there are enough fish to catch in following years. There is a long process of capturing data on fisheries activates, and fish stock abundances in Scottish waters and beyond. The base for much of this activity is at the Marine Laboratory in Aberdeen. This talk will take you through examples of technology used and data collected, to be able to provide scientific advice about the amount of fish we can catch while keeping Scottish Seas sustainable.<\/p> <p>Talk 2 - Dr Eyad Elyan<br/>Class-imbalanced datasets are common across different domains such as health, banking, security and others. With such datasets, the class of interest is significantly underrepresented in the dataset leading to biased results. This talk will present some of the latest work that has been developed at the School of Computing using advanced deep learning models, and discuss how it was applied to solve real-world scenarios including hand-written characters/digits recognition, and analysis of complex engineering drawings.<\/p> <p>Dr. Elyan has 20 yeas of experience in Academia and Industry. He obtained his first degree in Computer Science in 1999 from Al Quds University (Palestine). In 2004, he was awarded an MSc in Software Engineering with distinction. In 2008 at the University of Bradford obtained his PhD for his work on 3D modelling, representation, and recognition of human faces from 3D images.<\/p> <p>Currently, he is a Reader (Associate Professor) in Machine Learning at the School of Computing Science and Digital Media at Robert Gordon University and he is leading the Machine Learning and Vision Applications research group. His research in the area of machine learning and machine vision is primarily focused on creating novel methods to represent and extract knowledge from unstructured and complex documents and images and structured data and applying it to solve industrial problems.<\/p> <p>Elyan is a Fellow member of the British Higher Education Academy. He served as a Program Committee member for several international conferences and as a reviewer for several international journals in the area of machine vision, machine learning and data analytics and he has published more than 50 articles in the are of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Neural Network and Ensemble Learning.<\/p> <p>More information projects, research output and others can be found at <a href=\"https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/elyan-eyad\" class=\"linkified\">https://www3.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/elyan-eyad<\/a><\/p> <p>*****************************<br/>Thanks to MBN Solutions, Data Lab Scotland and Scotland IS for sponsoring this event.<\/p> <p>Photo by Sime Basioli on Unsplash<\/p> ",

Her first book is a revelatory treatise on plant life—but it is also so much more.<\/p> <p>Lab Girl is a book about work, love, and the mountains that can be moved when those two things come together. It is told through Jahren’s stories: about her childhood in rural Minnesota with an uncompromising mother and a father who encouraged hours of play in his classroom’s labs; about how she found a sanctuary in science, and learned to perform lab work done “with both the heart and the hands”; and about the inevitable disappointments, but also the triumphs and exhilarating discoveries, of scientific work.<\/p> <p>Yet at the core of this book is the story of a relationship Jahren forged with a brilliant, wounded man named Bill, who becomes her lab partner and best friend. Their sometimes rogue adventures in science take them from the Midwest across the United States and back again, over the Atlantic to the ever-light skies of the North Pole and to tropical Hawaii, where she and her lab currently make their home.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

I will be presenting some examples.<\/p> <p>Abstract<br/>Data wrangling is a critical foundation of data science, and wrangling of categorical data is an important component of this process. However, categorical data can introduce unique issues in data wrangling, particularly in real-world settings with collaborators and periodically-updated dynamic data. This paper discusses common problems arising from categorical variable transformations in R, demonstrates the use of factors, and suggests approaches to address data wrangling challenges. For each problem, we present at least two strategies for management, one in base R and the other from the ‘tidyverse.’ We consider several motivating examples, suggest defensive coding strategies, and outline principles for data wrangling to help ensure data quality and sound analysis.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>What will we cover in this hands-on workshop?<br/>To get data into R, the first step is to import it. It’s very common to get data from databases, csv files, Excel files, APIs, or from websites through HTML tables. One less common but tricky way to get data is from PDFs. PDFs come in 2 forms - machine readable and non-machine readable. Dr. Stephanie Zimmer will give examples of both and discuss some tricks and tips she's learned to get these data into R so they can be analyzed. The bulk of the work will be done by two packages: pdftools and tesseract. We will also use the tidyverse package to parse data once it's in R.<\/p> <p>What's the schedule?<br/>6:00pm - 6:15pm - Networking<br/>6:15pm - 6:35pm - Lightning Talks*<br/>6:35pm - 6:45pm - Set up (install R packages, etc.)<br/>6:45pm - 7:45pm - Workshop<br/>7:45pm - 8:00pm - Wrap up<\/p> <p>*We are looking for Lightning Talk presenters!

Previously, she was a data scientist at Rue Gilt Groupe, incorporating data science and machine learning in retail space to drive revenue and enhance personalized shopping experiences of customers. She earned her Ph.D. degree in computer science at Boston University.<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>With the recent popularity of machine learning algorithms such as neural networks and ensemble methods, etc., machine learning models become more like a ‘black box’, harder to understand and interpret. To gain the user’s trust, there is a strong need to develop tools and methodologies to help the user to understand and explain how predictions are made. Data scientists also need to have the necessary insights to learn how the model can be improved. Much research has gone into model interpretability and recently several open sources tools, including LIME, SHAP, and GAMs, etc., have been published on GitHub. In this talk, we present popular state-of-the-art interpretability algorithms and introduce a Machine Learning Interpretability toolkit which incorporates the cutting-edge technologies in the domain of AI transparency. Using this toolkit, data scientists can explain machine learning models using state-of-art technologies in an easy-to-use and scalable fashion.<\/p> <p>ODSC Links:<br/>• Get free access to more talks like this at LearnAI:<br/><a href=\"https://learnai.odsc.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://learnai.odsc.com/<\/a><br/>• Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/OPENDATASCI/<\/a><br/>• Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/odsc\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/odsc<\/a> &amp; @odsc<br/>• LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-data-science/<\/a><br/>• West Conference Oct 29 - Nov 1: <a href=\"https://odsc.com/california\" class=\"linkified\">https://odsc.com/california<\/a><br/>• Europe Conference Nov 19 - 22: <a href=\"https://odsc.com/london\" class=\"linkified\">https://odsc.com/london<\/a><\/p> ",

The tools that<br/>we build for personalization, marketing, and advertising are being<br/>directly leveraged by actors with political and ideological<br/>motivations. Engineering ethics require that we understand and face<br/>the consequences of the tools that we're building, and work to<br/>mitigate the harmful externalities of the tools and technologies that<br/>we create.<\/p> <p>To understand the harm, and how to mitigate it, we need to take a<br/>cross-functional look at what we're building. In particular, we need<br/>to look at our products through not just a data science lens, but also<br/>through the lenses of security, economics, and information and<br/>psychological operations.<\/p> <p>In this talk we'll look at modern data driven advertising and<br/>personalization and understand how they can be leveraged for harmful<br/>political and idealogical activities, including as tools for<br/>information and psychological warfare. Throughout the talk we'll<br/>address adversarial thinking and threat modeling as key components of<br/>understanding how the products we built are being used.

    "description": "<p>We are very happy to announce our next meetup, on the 9th of October. This event will be held at Tramshed Tech (tramshedtech.co.uk), kindly sponsored by AMPLYFI (amplyfi.com) who are providing us with the venue together with food and refreshments. And of course, we are offering free beer, soft drinks and pizza.<\/p> <p>The venue will open at 18:30 when drinks will be provided. The talks will then begin at 19:00 with a break in between for refreshments. After the event, we will be heading to a local Brew Dog pub that is close to Cardiff Central Station.<\/p> <p>Talk 1: Timo Mulder - Building a custom text miner in a day<\/p> <p>What would you do if your colleague dumped about 200 URLs to annual company reports in your mailbox and asked you to come back with an analysis? Indeed, scrape docs -&gt; extract text -&gt; clean text -&gt; extract entities and phrases -&gt; filter -&gt; results. This talk touches on several universally applicable NLP and text mining methods and shows how to quickly implement them from scratch. Timo is a Senior NLP Engineer @ AMPLYFI.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Dr Vincent Knight - Game Theory. Reinforcement learning and The Prisoner’s Dilemma<\/p> <p>Game theory is the study of strategic interaction. In this talk I will give an overview of the subject itself. I will then go on to describe some ongoing research in the field that combines reinforcement learning, evolutionary processes and an explanation as to how lizards might share sources of warmth. Vincent is a Senior Lecturer in Maths @ Cardiff University.<\/p> <p>We are incredibly grateful to have these speakers coming, and we invite you all to come to enjoy the evening with us in Cardiff.<\/p> <p>FREE WORKSHOP:<br/>As has happened in the previous 2 meetups, there will be a short workshop before the talks for anyone who wishes to attend. This workshop will be an introduction to the pandas library that allows users to view tabular data in dataframes, and allows for database-like functionality. Many say that their Python coding lives are in 2 stages - the times before pandas... and those afterwards! It will feature examples of how to load in data from both text, and Excel files, together with information on how to reshape and analyse data in dataframes, and how to combine dataframes together. We will also look at using basic visualisation of our data, and examine the concepts of how to use the dataframe index, which can also take on multiple layers.<br/>No need to book, just turn up to the venue from 17:30 onwards. You can bring a laptop to work along, or the material can be worked through at a later time if you prefer. Any updates will be emailed before the date.<\/p> <p>We also have some local representatives from a Cardiff based recruitment firm, IntaPeople, present. So if anyone is interested in learning more about the local job market for data science, then this is a great opportunity.<\/p> <p>The event will be covered by the PyData Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct<\/a>, and we would like to stress that one of the main goals of NumFocus and PyData is to increase diversity in the data science field. Our aim is to have an entertaining and informative evening, which will be a welcoming and safe space for everyone, from all backgrounds and technical abilities.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>The Timeseries Talks are Back! We are very excited to have David Rawlinson and Gideon Kowadlo from Project AGI present a cutting edge RNN talk.<\/p> <p>David and Gideon present a recurrent neural network memory that uses sparse coding to create a combinatoric encoding of sequential inputs. Using several examples, they show that the network can associate distant causes and effects in a discrete stochastic process, predict partially-observable higher-order sequences, and enable a DQN agent to navigate a maze by giving it memory. The network uses only biologically-plausible, local and immediate credit assignment. Memory requirements are typically one order of magnitude less than existing LSTM, GRU and autoregressive feed-forward sequence learning models. The most significant limitation of the memory is generalization to unseen input sequences. They explore this limitation by measuring next-word prediction perplexity on the Penn Treebank dataset.<\/p> <p>About the speakers:<\/p> <p>David Rawlinson<br/>David has been working in applied AI/ML for approximately 20 years in both industry and academia. These include finance &amp; retail business analytics, security / surveillance, and med-tech particularly genomics, bioinformatics and medical imaging. Many of these systems are used everyday in the real world from banking and parking enforcement to radiology and monitoring of financial transactions in many countries around the world. He studied computer science &amp; artificial intelligence at Sussex University (UK) back at the end of the AI winter, later moving to Monash University in Australia to complete a PhD in computer vision for mobile robots. Afterwards he worked for Melbourne University and Data61 (formerly NICTA) for several years. David now works on research towards more general purpose machine learning looking at alternative methods of credit assignment and continuous learning.<\/p> <p>Gideon Kowadlo<br/>Gideon has spent 20+ years bringing emerging technologies to life in Australia and overseas, in areas from Robotics to Human Motor Control and from Mobile to Bio-inspired AI. He gets directly involved as well as leading and empowering teams to make an impact. He is a co-founder of Outware Mobile, Hoist AI and Project AGI. Outware Mobile began in 2009 and quickly became Australia’s leading app developer before becoming part of Arq Group a few years ago. Hoist AI supports AI startups that want to improve the world.<\/p> <p>How to find us:<br/>Once you enter the Outcome.life building take the lift or the stairs to the top floor.<\/p> <p>Our venue, Outcome.life will be asking all attendees to register for security reasons.<\/p> <p>We'll start the talk at 6:10,pm come at 6:00pm for networking.

    "description": "<p>Winner of the 2019 Burlington Data Science Golden Flame Award, Katie McCurdy will expand on the very popular talk she gave at our rapid fire session last January.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THIS TALK...<br/>Our communication with our doctors is broken. Ineffective processes and systems prevent us from telling rich stories – the kind we need to fully understand each other. As a result, many patients aren't getting the correct diagnosis; 12 million people in the U.S. are misdiagnosed or remain undiagnosed each year. Patients with invisible symptoms or those who have especially complicated backgrounds suffer most. They often aren't understood or believed by their doctors, and they end up repeating their stories over and over.<\/p> <p>Visuals can help us communicate more efficiently and develop a better mutual understanding. Presenter and designer Katie McCurdy has experienced this firsthand; as a patient with multiple autoimmune conditions, she has used drawings, graphs, timelines and other visuals in her doctor appointments to make better use of our short time together and help them ‘see’ what she is experiencing.<\/p> <p>These experiences inspired her to start a company called Pictal Health to bring visual communication to more patients and doctors. Pictal Health helps people put together detailed timelines, symptom maps, and a neat and organized summary of their health history so that they can see and understand what happened, tell their story with confidence, and work together better with their doctors.<\/p> <p>After piloting an intensive, supportive health history visualization process with over 50 patients and healthcare providers, Katie has learned key insights about how others represent their symptoms and stories, what elements of our stories are important to ‘show’ to our doctors, how to avoid overwhelming visual representations, and more. She is excited to share all of this with you!<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKER...<br/>Katie McCurdy is an autoimmune patient, designer, and founder of Pictal Health. She is on a mission to use visual communication and human-centered design to help patients tell their stories, help providers focus on the work they love, and facilitate better collaboration between all healthcare stakeholders.<\/p> <p>Before starting Pictal Health, Katie consulted with the University of Vermont Medical Center, working to improve the patient and provider experience using human-centered design. Prior to that, she designed apps and products for startups Medal, Medivo, and Notabli; health data non-profit Open mHealth; and clients like LabCorp, Verizon and Johnson &amp; Johnson.<\/p> <p>She holds a Masters of Science in Information with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction from the University of Michigan School of Information. She lives, skis, hikes, and eats chocolate in Burlington, VT. Learn more about Katie at katiemccurdy.com.<\/p> ",

First, we will discuss why we chose Druid, highlighting the features which were impossible to implement with the old solution and which unlocked opportunities for us to bring deeper analytical capabilities to our ads platform. Next, we will take you through the long journey it took to change our access patterns and productionize Druid in our ecosystem:<br/>Development of our special ingestion process on top of Apache Spark<br/>Namespacing of segments to allow ingestions from multiple pipelines<br/>Metadata service to short-circuit querying non-existent data<br/>The choice of Native vs SQL querying<br/>Effort of tuning access patterns from HBase-friendly to Druid-friendly.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Filip Jaros is a software engineer at Pinterest. Starting his career in VoIP technologies, he has worked in the ads space for the last five years focusing on developing scalable ETL pipelines, designing database schemas and data retrieval services.

This talk will examine how the Druid UX is being redesigned from the ground up. This will make Druid straightforward to get started with, load data into, and manage at scale.<\/p> <p>Bio: Vadim Ogievetsky, co-founder of Imply, cares about two things: making huge datasets accessible to everyone, and highly complex distributed systems easier to manage. Previously Vadim led the Application team at Metamarkets (acquired by Snap).
