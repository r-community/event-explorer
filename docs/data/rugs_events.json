The talk begins with a discussion of fundamental command-line topics like managing output streams, exit codes, and environment variables. After that, the talk will explain each argument to the \"Rscript\" executable. The talk will then describe how to write your own R programs that take in command-line arguments, using builtin functions like `commandArgs()` and external packages like {argparse} and {crayon}. The talk concludes with a demo of two R command-line interfaces used in the {lightgbm} project: one for running linting with {lintr} in continuous integration and one for building a C++ library using CMake. Sample code will be available on GitHub prior to and following the talk.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: James Lamb<\/p> <p>James Lamb is an engineer at Saturn Cloud, where he works on a team building a managed Dask + Kubernetes product. He is a maintainer on {lightgbm}, and has made many contributions to other open source data science projects, including {xgboost} and prefect. He is also a maintainer and co-author of two other packages on CRAN: {pkgnet} and {uptasticsearch}. He holds masters degrees in Applied Economics (2014) and Data Science (2018). Before joining Saturn, he worked as an IoT Data Scientist at Amazon Web Services and Uptake.<\/p> <p>**Talk 2**<\/p> <p>While working remotely, I often have client projects where RStudio is unavailable for data security reasons or otherwise. R is feature-rich environment for terminal users as well, and I will discuss the underappreciated<br/>functions around highlighting, graphics, editor integration, and other nice-to-haves for day-to-day<br/>usage of the terminal.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: Neal Fultz<\/p> <p>Neal Fultz is a long-time friend of the LA RUG/Tech community.

    "description": "<p>Are you looking to improve our R skills? Come just us for a book club. It will be headed up by John Peach. The idea is to motivate us to read books and discussing them together. This will help all of us to develop our skills.<\/p> <p>The format will be that the leader will prepare a short summary of the material and present it to the group. We will then discuss the material and do some exercises.<\/p> <p>The expectations are that you will attend regularly. If you cannot make a commitment to attend, please wait until the next book club starts. It is also expected that participants will take turns being the leader. The leader should prepare a summary of the material that was read and present it to the group.<\/p> <p>We will meet each week, Monday evening between 6:30 and 8:00 PM for six weeks.<\/p> <p>Book: Title: Text Mining with R<br/>Online: <a href=\"https://www.tidytextmining.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tidytextmining.com/<\/a><br/>Dead Tree: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491981652/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491981652/<\/a><\/p> <p>Signing up: When you sign-up you will be placed on the waiting list. We always have a lot of interest but the book club is a significant commitment. The coordinator will confirm your commitment. Please make sure that you get meet-up emails.<\/p> <p>Session 1:<br/>* C1: The Tidy Text Format<br/>* C2: Sentiment Analysis with Tidy Data<br/>* Exercise<\/p> <p>Session 2:<br/>* C3: Analyzing Word and Document Frequency: tf-idf<br/>* C4: Relationships Between Words: N-grams and Correlations<br/>* Exercise<\/p> <p>Session 3:<br/>* C5: Converting to and from Nontidy Formats<br/>* C6: Topic Modeling<\/p> <p>Session 4:<br/>* C7: Case Study: Comparing Twitter Archives<br/>* Exercise<\/p> <p>Session 5:<br/>* C8: Case Study: Mining NASA Metadata<br/>* Exercise<\/p> <p>Session 6:<br/>* C9: Case Study: Analyzing Usenet Text<br/>* Exercise<\/p> ",

I am a conscientious person who works hard and pays<br/>attention to detail. Experienced in interpreting and analysing data to drive the growth of the company. I am an<br/>effective communicator with excellent interpersonal relationship and management skills. My greatest strength is strong<br/>analytical thinking, which enables me to furnish insights, analyse data, build machine learning and deep learning<br/>models to leverage business to guide their decisions. I am also experienced in coordinating with stakeholders. I<br/>create content on YouTube to help others in the data science field; I am a qualified gym instructor and personal trainer.<\/p> <p>### Talk: Data Optimisation Network<br/>The Data Optimisation Network (DON) seeks to improve business decision-making using machine intelligence and data science<br/>techniques. It predicts customer behaviour through data-driven insights to enable the business to acquire new customers<br/>intelligently. The key problem with most of the companies is not just to acquire more customers, but it is to acquire the right customers and retain them. Companies consider the cost of customer acquisition as an important measure in evaluating how much value a customer will bring to their businesses. DON will empower teams such as Customer Value<br/>Management, Marketing, Sales, Continuous Improvement and more via interactive dashboards available in real-time.<br/>These dashboards will enable research, and the understanding of market trends and behaviours. The demonstration of the app is based on the utility sector. However, the data is anonymised for the solution but depicts the real-life problem.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event is kindly sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

They can be used to identify popular topics among different legislators, reveal party factions that do not show up in voting behaviour, and longitudinal<br/>changes in the language used to discuss certain topics, amongst other things. In this webinar I'll discuss some approaches<br/>and potential pitfalls to analysing legislative debate, using the British House of Commons as an example.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event is kindly sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

However, they often struggle with increasingly larger data volumes, reverting back to bottlenecking data access to manage large numbers of data engineering requests and rising data warehousing costs. To address this, a next-gen cloud data lake architecture has emerged that brings together the best attributes of the data warehouse and the data lake. This new open data architecture is built to maximize data access with minimal data movement and no data copies.<\/p> <p>- How “no data copy” approach dramatically streamlines data workflows while reducing security and governance overhead<br/>- Why agile development concepts, when applied to the data tier, can dramatically increase data engineering agility<br/>- How to separate compute and data by preserving data in open file and table formats<br/>- How a next-generation cloud data lake architecture brings together the best attributes of data warehouse and data lakes to truly democratize data<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://apache-arrow-datalake.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://apache-arrow-datalake.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Viktor Kessler<br/>LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktor-kessler/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/viktor-kessler/<\/a><br/>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ViktorKessler\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/ViktorKessler<\/a><\/p> <p>Viktor Kessler is Senior Solutions Architect at Dremio and a ex-MongoDB Senior Solutions Architect.<\/p> <p>### ABOUT THE X-EUROPE DATA SCIENCE WEBINARS<\/p> <p>X-Europe Webinar Series is a joint online event of Vienna Data Science Group, Frankfurt Data Science, Budapest Data Science Meetup, BCN Analytics, Budapest.AI, Barcelona Data Science and Machine Learning Meetup, Budapest Deep Learning Reading Seminar, Warsaw R Users Group, PyData Slovakia, and Data Scientists Ireland.<\/p> ",

This type of work often involves trade processing, trade confirmation, and settlement of payments. In many institutions, much of this work is done manually using excel spreadsheets. This presentation will focus on how someone in the back-office can use R to automate manual processes and how they might convince others on their team to join the journey.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Mandip Mistry is a Business Analyst at the Health Care of Ontario Pension Plan. In his role, he is responsible for enhancements and ongoing support of HOOPP's internal stress testing system which provides risk reporting to a variety of stakeholders within the organization. Before this, he spent 5 years in Investment Operations (aka back-office) helping automate manual excel processes while developing a healthy obsession for all things R. Mandip is also a certified tidyverse instructor currently working with back and middle office staff who have fallen out of love with Excel.<\/p> <p>This is a cross-post from the group here: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/RStudio-Enterprise-Community-Meetup\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/RStudio-Enterprise-Community-Meetup<\/a><\/p> <p>You can RSVP here on the Boston group though and don't have to join the group above, well unless you want to :)<\/p> ",

In my presentation, I will show you three small projects I conducted related to the pandemic, and look for your feedback. First, I analyzed COVID-19 case trends across the State of Washington, particularly in Spokane, in order for myself to see behind daily case counts, and still looking for ways to expand that. Second, I tested the oft-heard suggestion that increased case numbers in the fall of 2020 were simply due to increased testing, using bootstrapping methods. Finally, I developed a stochastic, spatially explicit model to simulate COVID-19 transmission within a facility, such as a dorm, with visualization conducted in R.<\/p> <p>Speaker Profile: Krisztian Magori,Ph.D., is a Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Department of Biology at Eastern Washington University. He teaches biostatistics using R at both the undergraduate and graduate level, and consults with faculty and students on statistical analysis of their datasets. In addition, he is a disease ecologist, focusing on ticks and mosquitoes, when we don't have a pandemic that's more important.<\/p> ",

Lately, there’s been an explosion of new R packages that allow us to take these data tables and make them presentable in publication contexts. A package Rich Iannone has been working on, called gt, is great for taking a data frame and making it look good (and more like a table you’d find on the web or in print). Rich will show us some examples of how the gt package works, where it works well, and where other packages might do better for specific needs.

Such a graphical representation is convenient, since, for high-dimensional problems the local interpretation of a subset of variables can be interpreted in the sub-graph induced by these variables and variables connected to these. By exploiting the graph-theoretic representation, general algorithms can be used for computing marginal and conditional probabilities. For problems large enough, it can be impossible to compute such probabilities without exploiting the graphical representation. Of particular importance for calculations of probabilities in graphical models is the Junction Tree Algorithm (JTA).<\/p> ",

Please see event details below:<br/>----------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Alastair Rushworth (Tesco Bank)<\/p> <p>Title: Exploring EDA with R<\/p> <p>Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (aka EDA) is one of the most important tools in the data scientist’s toolkit, while also being one of the hardest to codify and teach. EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modelling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk). Since completing his PhD in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London in 2011, Matthew has worked in technical and non-technical roles in academia, the commercial sector, and the public sector - with a focus on managing diverse stakeholders and developing data-driven products and solutions.<\/p> ",

The talk begins with a discussion of fundamental command-line topics like managing output streams, exit codes, and environment variables. After that, the talk will explain each argument to the \"Rscript\" executable. The talk will then describe how to write your own R programs that take in command-line arguments, using builtin functions like `commandArgs()` and external packages like {argparse} and {crayon}. The talk concludes with a demo of two R command-line interfaces used in the {lightgbm} project: one for running linting with {lintr} in continuous integration and one for building a C++ library using CMake.

Such a graphical representation is convenient, since, for high-dimensional problems the local interpretation of a subset of variables can be interpreted in the sub-graph induced by these variables and variables connected to these. By exploiting the graph-theoretic representation, general algorithms can be used for computing marginal and conditional probabilities. For problems large enough, it can be impossible to compute such probabilities without exploiting the graphical representation. Of particular importance for calculations of probabilities in graphical models is the Junction Tree Algorithm (JTA).<\/p> ",

His background spans from biotechnology to bioinformatics and biostatistics. His research focuses on prostate and breast tumour microenvironment, the development of statistical model for the analysis of RNA sequencing data, and data analysis and visualisation interfaces.<\/p> <p>▶️ About Dr. Maria Doyle:<br/>Dr. Maria Doyle is the Application and Training Specialist for Research Computing at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia. She has a PhD in Molecular Biology and currently works in bioinformatics and data science education and training. She is passionate about supporting researchers, reproducible research, open source and tidy data.<\/p> <p>▶️ About the workshop:<\/p> <p>This workshop will present how to perform analysis of RNA sequencing data following the tidy data paradigm (Wickham and others 2014). The tidy data paradigm provides a standard way to organise data values within a dataset, where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and data is manipulated using an easy-to-understand vocabulary. Most importantly, the data structure remains consistent across manipulation and analysis functions.<br/>This can be achieved for RNA sequencing data with the tidybulk, tidyHeatmap (Mangiola and Papenfuss 2020) and tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) packages. The tidybulk package provides a tidy data structure and a modular framework for bulk transcriptional analyses. tidyHeatmap provides a tidy implementation of ComplexHeatmap. These packages are part of the tidytranscriptomics suite that introduces a tidy approach to RNA sequencing data representation and analysis. The last section of the workshop will be focused on the analysis of single cell data in a tidy fashion with the packages tidySCE and tidyseurat.<\/p> <p>The topics presented in this workshop will be:<\/p> <p>▪️ Data exploration<br/>▪️ Data dimensionality reduction and clustering<br/>▪️ Differential gene expression analysis<br/>▪️ Data visualisation<\/p> <p>In order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉 <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y88sxkos\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/y88sxkos<\/a><\/p> <p>We will send you the Zoom link and the enter passcode a few hours before the training session.

    "description": "<p>Alastair Rushworth (Tesco Bank)<\/p> <p>Title: Exploring EDA with R<\/p> <p>Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (aka EDA) is one of the most important tools in the data scientist’s toolkit, while also being one of the hardest to codify and teach. EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modelling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk). Since completing his PhD in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London in 2011, Matthew has worked in technical and non-technical roles in academia, the commercial sector, and the public sector - with a focus on managing diverse stakeholders and developing data-driven products and solutions.<\/p> ",

Such a graphical representation is convenient, since, for high-dimensional problems the local interpretation of a subset of variables can be interpreted in the sub-graph induced by these variables and variables connected to these. By exploiting the graph-theoretic representation, general algorithms can be used for computing marginal and conditional probabilities. For problems large enough, it can be impossible to compute such probabilities without exploiting the graphical representation. Of particular importance for calculations of probabilities in graphical models is the Junction Tree Algorithm (JTA).<\/p> ",

No se utilizan fórmulas matemáticas, en un intento de hacerlo amigable e intuitivo y así poder dar atención a una audiencia más amplia.<br/>Para aprovechar mejor este taller, es necesario tener algo de experiencia con análisis exploratorio de datos y modelos lineales, de tal manera de poder transitar sin mucho obstáculo teórico por cada una de las etapas del modelamiento con efectos mixtos. Además, es necesario contar con conocimientos iniciales de algunos paquetes del tidyverse (como {readr} y {dplyr}).<\/p> <p>- REQUERIMIENTOS<\/p> <p>Además de {tidyverse} y {tidymodels}, que utilizamos en la primera parte de este taller, es necesario instalar los siguientes paquetes:<\/p> <p>&gt; install.packages(c(\"broom.mixed\",\"lme4\",\"lmerTest\"))<\/p> <p>Luego del taller se dejarán referencias para quienes tengan interés en una explicación más detallada sobre modelos mixtos y {tidymodels}, de tal manera que cuando comiencen a usar estas herramientas con sus propios datos dispongan de mayor información.

We continue our meetups with #goodRvibes and a speaker you'll definitely enjoy!<\/p> <p>Three reasons to use tidymodels with Julia Silge<\/p> <p>Modeling and machine learning in R involve a bewildering array of heterogeneous packages, and establishing good statistical practice is challenging in any language. The tidymodels (tidymodels.org) collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, we’ll focus on three specific reasons to consider using tidymodels. We will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering.<\/p> <p>Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC where she works on open source modeling tools. She is an author, an international keynote speaker, and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice. Julia loves text analysis, making beautiful charts, and communicating about technical topics with diverse audiences.<\/p> <p>Registration is free, but mandatory via meetup.

She received her Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles. Her area of expertise includes design of experiments, statistical methods and applications, survey methods, and discrete choice experiments. Her recent projects include the development of a new class of experimental designs that provide higher efficiency, more in-depth analyses, and require a shorter time to run. This research has led to multiple interdisciplinary funded projects.<\/p> <p>Abstract: As science and technology progress, this often calls for innovation in methodological and theoretical development of statistical experimental design, an essential aspect for research in any discipline. This research concentrates on the close connection between statistics and medicine, and the development of novel experiments to maximize efficiency, while minimizing time and costs. The focus of this talk will be on an application of an undergraduate research project using a novel experimental design known as an Orthogonal Array Composite Design (OACD) with applications to KB oral cancer. In particular, this talk will highlight the methods and applications that undergraduate students contributed to. Furthermore, various takeaways will be presented in terms of tips, challenges, and benefits in working with undergraduate students. sources.<\/p> <p># Modernizing Design of Experiment Output with Tidyverse<br/>Speaker: Jose Toledo<br/>Graduate Student, Statistics Dept, CSU Fullerton<\/p> <p>Bio: Jose is currently in his last semester in the Master’s in statistics program at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), where he is also a teaching associate. Additionally, he is a part-time data analyst at Southern California Coast Water Project. His research interest is in the field of Design of Experiments, where he has worked on projects such as drug combination treatments for KB oral cancer and recently in tuberculosis. During his summer breaks he enjoys mentoring undergraduate students in local community colleges and providing them research opportunities early in their education.<\/p> <p>Abstract: Most Design of Experiment (DoE) experts will agree that using FrF2 is the most comprehensive R package for generating two-level factorial designs as well as Plackett-Burman type screening designs. Similarly, for sequential optimization with first order and second order response surface models, that offer optimization approaches like steepest ascent and visualization of the response function for linear model objects, the package rsm is highly recommended. However, their graphical outputs are limited and can benefit from the current “trends” in R such as implementing graphics using ggplot2. This talk will focus on the development of an R package, ggDoE, which focuses on the visualization of DoE using ggplot2. Examples will be taken from a TB drug combination experiment and demonstrate the output of commonly used methods in DoE. These methods include but are not limited to: factorial effect plots, half-normal plots, Lenth’s method, fitting second-order models and their corresponding contour plots.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Just getting involved with R or want to level up your skills? Have you used base-R but are still trying to wrap your head around the tidyverse \"pipe\" (%&gt;%)? Have a messy dataset and don't know where to start? Seen beautiful visualizations on Twitter and want to make your own?<\/p> <p>If you’ve answered ‘yes’ to at least one of these questions, fear no more! In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with. You will be able to create new columns and summary tables, subset interesting rows or columns, and combine and reshape dataframes. We will also dive into ggplot, one of the best tools for creating great-looking bar charts, scatterplots, and more!<\/p> <p>This is (currently) a five-part series, aimed at total beginners and/or people with some experience in base-R or tidyverse who are looking to freshen up or expand their skills. Feel free to join at any point, we will briefly review the previous topic at the beginning of each session.<\/p> <p>January 20th {Part 1}: The R &amp; R-Studio ABCs (packages, files, data types &amp; basic data exploration)<br/>February 17th {Part 2}: Tidy data &amp; introduction to data wrangling (tibbles, renaming, reordering, subsetting)<br/>March 17th {Part 3}: Data wrangling with dplyr (new columns, if-else statements, summary tables, joining dataframes)<br/>April 21st {Part 4}: Introduction to visualizations with ggplot (line graphs, bar charts, scatterplots, histograms, and more!)<br/>May 19th {Part 5}: Advanced topics in wrangling and ggplot (pivoting, ggplot style options, etc.)<\/p> <p>Please install R and R-Studio before joining: <a href=\"https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html<\/a><\/p> <p>Image by the amazing @allison_horst: <a href=\"https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations<\/a><\/p> ",

The range of functionalities has expanded and some very interesting extensions have been created. There is the officedown package that increases the layout capabilities of R Markdown when the output is Word, the rvg package to create editable vector graphics, the flextable package to make nice tables.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, you will see how to use the package to produce PowerPoint presentations and Word documents. Its role as a foundation for other packages and new documentation will be discussed. It will also be an opportunity for David to present the officedown package for the first time.<\/p> <p>## Speaker<\/p> <p>David Gohel is the founder of ArData, a French company providing R expertise, R training and consulting in data sciences. He is the author of R packages, most popular are officer, flextable, rvg and ggiraph.<\/p> <p>He is a data scientist and software engineer.

I specifically look at 24 hours of recordings of talk about Type 1 Diabetes relative to Tweets within the context of the diabetes online community. This comparison allows us to assess how representative the concerns raised in the conversations are of the world-wide discourses around Type 1 Diabetes on English-language Twitter, and in how far they are specific to the participants or to the location these participants are from.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Does it have to look like a 90’s website? Introduction to CSS and HTML for styling interactive outputs in R<\/p> <p>### Elliot Meador<\/p> <p>In this talk we will review some easy wins when it comes to styling interactive outputs in R, including Shiny web applications and flexdashboards. Specifically, we’ll discuss Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and how they can be used to add some pizazz to the base Shiny and flexdashboards. We will then discuss layouts and workflows that are best suited for styling your interactive R outputs.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>/federico<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Spend Friday night discussing Data Feminism (<a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/Data-Feminism-Catherine-DIgnazio/9780262044004\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.bookdepository.com/Data-Feminism-Catherine-DIgnazio/9780262044004<\/a>).<\/p> <p>A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism.<\/p> <p>Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.<\/p> <p>Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”<\/p> <p>Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed..<\/p> <p>PS This book is available free online: <a href=\"https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/<\/a><\/p> ",

It predicts customer behaviour through data driven insights to enable business to acquire new customer intelligently. Main Key problem with most of the companies is not just to acquire more customers but it is to acquire the right customers and retain them. Companies consider the cost of customer acquisition as an important measure in evaluating how much value a customer will bring to their businesses. DON will empower teams such as Customer Value Management, Marketing, Sales, Continuous Improvement and more via interactive dashboards available in real time. These dashboards will enable research and the understanding of market trends and behaviours. The demonstration of the app is based on utility sector. However, the data is anonymised for the solution but depicts the real life problem.<\/p> <p>Biography: Process oriented Data Scientist with 9 years of experience.

EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modelling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk).

Note that since the you will want to be typing in your own jupyter notebook while watching the workshop, it is very helpful to have two screens so that you can watch the zoom meeting in one window and type in another window.<\/p> <p>While there are ways to access a programming environment online, I strongly recommend that you install python and set up a development environment on your own computer, so you can continue working in python after the workshop is over. These are the things you need to do to set up your computer to get ready for the workshop.<\/p> <p>1. Install anaconda. (<a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Anaconda is a python package manager. This means it is software that helps you install python and other python packages (we’ll talk more about what python packages are in the workshop). Go to the link above and download the appropriate package for your operating system. In virtually all cases, you want the 64-bit version and not the 32-bit. The default options are generally fine. If you are a windows user, be sure you choose Make anaconda the default python in the setup.<\/p> <p>2. Download the workshop files. (<a href=\"https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/data/data.zip\" class=\"linkified\">https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/data/data.zip<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Download the zip file linked above. Create a folder on your Desktop called python-workshop (use a dash or underscore in the name; do NOT use a space), move the zip file to your python-workshop folder, and unzip the file.<\/p> <p>3. Test your setup. From Finder or Spotlight (Mac OS) or the Start Menu (Windows) find the Anaconda Navigator. The icon looks like a green circle. Click Launch under Jupyter Notebook. It may take a few seconds to load the page, especially if it is the first time you have ever used the jupyter notebook, so don’t panic if nothing loads for a few seconds. Then a new window should open in your default internet browser. Use the file navigation window to navigate to Desktop and then to the python-workshop folder. In the upper right hand corner, click New, then choose Python 3 from the dropdown list. This should start a new jupyter notebook in python 3 and you are ready to go!<\/p> ",

EDA is often understood as an exercise undertaken at the beginning of a data science project, to expose insights and patterns that support, and eventually give way to more formal modeling or statistical analysis. But is this sufficient, or is there more to EDA than that? In this talk I will attempt to dig deeper into what EDA is for and how it can support an iterative process of learning and discovery, while also demonstrating some of the great R packages and tools that I have found useful along the way.<\/p> <p>Matthew Higgs<\/p> <p>Title: What can data scientists learn from data-driven responses to Covid-19?<\/p> <p>Abstract: Data-driven responses to Covid-19 have been developed at speed across the public sector, academia, and commercial sector - leading to a range of successes, failures, and opportunities for lessons to be learned. At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk). Since completing his PhD in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London in 2011, Matthew has worked in technical and non-technical roles in academia, the commercial sector, and the public sector - with a focus on managing diverse stakeholders and developing data-driven products and solutions.<\/p> ",

Explicitly embedding meaning in each component of variable names is a low-tech and low-friction approach which builds a shared understanding of how each field in the dataset is intended to work.<br/>Doing so can offload the burden of data producers by facilitating automated data validation and metadata management. At the same time, data consumers benefit by a reduction in the cognitive load to remember names, a deeper understanding of variable encoding, and opportunities to more efficiently analyze the resulting dataset.<br/>After discussing the theory of controlled vocabulary column-naming and related workflows, I will demonstrate how to implement the creation, upkeep, and application of controlled vocabularies with various softwares, including the R package {convo} and custom SQL templating and testing with dbt.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Emily Riederer is a Senior Analytics Manager at Capital One where she leads a team to develop and sustain data products (datamarts, R packages, and dashboards) for business users.

    "description": "<p>Our June Meetup will be a remote gathering; the Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Infographics are everywhere, and when well-designed can be a fantastic way of sharing data highlights in an engaging and visually appealing way to non-technical audiences. Typically infographics are custom made by a graphic designer who has been provided the numbers that will be represented in the graphic, and therefore can be time-intensive to produce. Producing more than one infographic of the same design to display different values (for instance, for different geographical areas) has a linear increase in production time for each n+1 graphic once the basic design time has been accounted for. This talk will describe a novel method for producing infographics using R that allows for dynamically adjusting the graphical elements based on any number of data values and rapidly producing bespoke versions. A walkthrough of the process used to create 3,142 custom infographics (one for each county in the US) will be presented to illustrate the process.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Zadra, PhD is a Director of Data Science at the non-profit Sorenson Impact Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.

His areas of focus include criminal justice data (including work with the PEW Charitable Trusts, Utah Department of Corrections, Utah Indigent Defense Commission, and Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice), early- and higher-education data including a multi-year project supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as other issue areas like homelessness or poverty, and has worked on many smaller projects building evaluations and impact measurements for a variety of social-good non-profits around the country.

    "group": "CalgaryR",
    "start": "2021-04-21",
    "description": "<p>We're happy to have a wonderful speaker and topic to start our first virtual meetup. Abed W Ayyad (<a href=\"https://manipulativegerbil.blogspot.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://manipulativegerbil.blogspot.com/<\/a>) will share his exploration of solar PV and how R can be used for solar PV in Alberta.<\/p> <p>Solar energy converted to electricity (photovoltaic, or PV, electricity) seems almost too good to be true when it comes to thinking about ways of reducing global carbon emissions. According to a widely repeated claim, one hour's worth of the solar radiation which falls on the earth's surface could meet human energy needs for one year. Though impressive and technically \"correct\", this is far from being a practical or meaningful calculation. So how much carbon-neutral electricity could someone sitting in the Canadian prairies actually harvest from the sunshine falling on their backyard?<\/p> <p>R lends itself perfectly to the data intensive task of planning and predicting the amount of solar insolation which falls on a given location, and the electricity which one can expect to harvest from it. Following a (very) broad introduction to solar energy and photovoltaics, we will explore a number of packages available in R which make it possible to access and analyse publicly available data on solar insolation, and to understand what this might mean in terms of solar PV potential at a site in Alberta. We will accomplish the latter by doing a walk-through of an example using the nasapower package available in CRAN, as well as a number of the graphics and GIS-related packages also available in R. This talk, aimed at a wide audience of R users, will illustrate why Alberta is a surprisingly perfect location for solar PV deployment and how you can convince yourself of that using R.<\/p> <p>About the speaker: Abed has used R in a variety of settings for seven years now, for GIS/cartography applications, data analysis and linear optimisation. There are many reasons to love R, but the community of users is definitely one of the biggest. Last September, Edmonton became the 10th city which Abed has called home during his life. Abed is looking forward to discovering more of the city, and to cycling to some parks and lakes as the summer goes on and the days get longer.<\/p> ",

    "start": "2021-04-22",
    "description": "<p>We have our second Rust talk in three months, this time about integrating R and Rust.<\/p> <p>Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Conversations during the meetup are encouraged in the monthly-meetup-chat channel in the nyhackr slack.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Rust is a relatively new programming language that is rapidly gaining in popularity. It is designed to be suitable for low-level system programming with high performance and low overhead while providing modern abstractions and protection from undefined behavior. The most common application scenarios for Rust are those that otherwise might be suitable for C or C++. As such, Rust may be a good choice for writing extensions to high-level interactive languages such as R. The extendr project was founded with the goal to make writing Rust extensions to R as easy and painless as possible. At the same time, extendr also enables the reverse use case, writing standalone Rust programs that call R code and take advantage of the R runtime. This talk will provide an overview of the extendr API and its key design choices, and it will highlight simple use cases and known pitfalls. The talk is meant primarily as an introduction to Rust for current R users. However, experienced Rust programmers who want to branch out into data science and statistical programming may also find this talk helpful.<\/p> <p>About Claus:<br/>Claus Wilke is the Jane and Roland Blumberg Centennial Professor in Molecular Evolution at The University of Texas at Austin. He holds a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Bochum in Germany, and he received postdoctoral training in biological physics in the lab of Chris Adami at Caltech. Claus Wilke has published extensively in the areas of computational biology, evolutionary biology, protein biochemistry, and virology. He has also authored several popular R packages used for data visualization, such as cowplot, ggridges, and ggtext, and he is a regular contributor to the package ggplot2.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EDT and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Productivity in R often boils down to automating repetitive steps, and iterating over a structured dataset is a common task in more complex data manipulation.<\/p> <p>There are many ways to achieve this: While some feel most comfortable writing procedural for-loops, others Vectorize() their functions in order to pass them multiple values at once. Yet another camp swears by the functional style of purrr's map() and reduce() functions (the tidy alternative to the the *apply family of functions in base R). And a fourth category of useRs struggle to get their head wrapped around serializiation in the first place. (Let's just ignore the hopeless cases who write straight-up recursive functions with no concern for stack size.)<\/p> <p>It has been rumored that a more functional style makes everything faster – but is that really true? Doesn't it make the code just too hard to read? And can any loop really be replaced by a map?<\/p> <p>For our May meeting, let's challenge the functional fanboys and *girls among us. Bring a contained, reproducible example loop (side effects welcome!) and we will ask the mapheads to reformulate it as a higher order function.<\/p> <p>As always, useRs of all backgrounds and at all levels of expertise are invited to participate.

    "description": "<p>Hello R-Ladies!<\/p> <p>Join us on April 28th for a workshop on Tidyverse functions!<\/p> <p>Event Description: Tidyverse functions were designed for their ease of use by humans, and are best known and used in interactive R coding, or as part of a literate code document (e.g., R Markdown) or script, where they are run in the global environment (i.e., not inside a function). Here they feel easy to use and powerful, as you can access things like column names as if they were available to you as objects themselves. However, this ease of use by humans is a trade off for “more work required” when you want to start programming with these. For example, when using them inside functions. In this short workshop, we will introduce what makes programming with Tidyverse functions challenging and how we can rise up to meet these challenges.<\/p> <p>**This workshop assumes you have used 2-3 Tidyverse functions and know how to write a function in R.

Have a messy dataset and don't know where to start? Seen beautiful visualizations on Twitter and want to make your own?<\/p> <p>If you’ve answered ‘yes’ to at least one of these questions, fear no more! In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with.

It lets you run exactly the same code – and achieve exactly the same results – sequentially on your laptop, in parallel on your laptop, in the cloud, or on large computing clusters. In this talk, Øystein will highlight various ways {future} lets you do your data science tasks more efficiently, from file system operations and preparation of large datasets to statistics and machine learning tasks like cross-validation, bootstrapping, and simulations. He'll focus particularly on functional programming with {future.apply} and {furrr} in parallel on a decent laptop, but will also touch upon cloud and cluster computing and package development.<\/p> <p>[Bio]<br/>Øystein Sørensen is an Associate Professor in Statistics at the Department of Psychology, University of Oslo (UiO). He works on both applied data analysis projects within cognitive neuroscience as well as development of new statistical tools, typically involving generalized additive models, and he is the author of four R packages. He received his PhD from the UiO in 2014, after which he worked as a data scientist in Storebrand and NextBridge analytics prior to joining UiO in 2018.

The event will happen online on May 4th 2021, at 6:30 pm CET.<\/p> <p>[ABOUT THE SPEAKER]<br/>-------------------------------<br/>Alexa is a quantitative ecologist and a postdoctoral associate at Rutgers University. In her work, she uses data science, modeling, and synthetic approaches to solve interdisciplinary environmental problems. Most of her research investigates how climate change and human activities alter ecological processes, and in particular, the change in movement and spatial distribution of species in response to climate change.<\/p> <p>[TOPIC]<br/>-----------<br/>In this talk, Alexa will share a little bit about her cutting-edge research and demonstrate how she uses modelling methods in R to understand and solve interdisciplinary research questions in the field ecology and climate change. This session will consist of a presentation followed by a hands-on workshop where you'll get a chance to work in R-studio running your own analysis! We GUARANTEE that you'll learn something new and come out of this session inspired and smiling! :)<\/p> <p>[PROGRAM]<br/>-----------------<br/>18.30 - 18.35 Virtual Welcome<br/>18.35 - 18.45 Intro to R-Ladies and today's presentation<br/>18.45 - 19:45 Interactive presentation + workshop by Alexa<br/>19:45 - 20:30 Q &amp; A + end of session discussion<\/p> <p>(timeslots subject to change)<\/p> <p>[ZOOM LINK]<br/>---------------<br/>Stay tuned!

They maintain the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. They nourish other living organisms and supply psychological benefits to humans as well, improving our moods and beautifying the landscape around us. But plants don’t just passively provide. They also take action.<\/p> <p>Beronda L. Montgomery explores the vigorous, creative lives of organisms often treated as static and predictable. In fact, plants are masters of adaptation. They “know” what and who they are, and they use this knowledge to make a way in the world. Plants experience a kind of sensation that does not require eyes or ears. They distinguish kin, friend, and foe, and they are able to respond to ecological competition despite lacking the capacity of fight-or-flight. Plants are even capable of transformative behaviors that allow them to maximize their chances of survival in a dynamic and sometimes unfriendly environment.<\/p> <p>Lessons from Plants enters into the depth of botanic experience and shows how we might improve human society by better appreciating not just what plants give us but also how they achieve their own purposes. What would it mean to learn from these organisms, to become more aware of our environments and to adapt to our own worlds by calling on perception and awareness? Montgomery’s meditative study puts before us a question with the power to reframe the way we live: What would a plant do?<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>For the April 20th edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Dr. Jennifer Victor as our guest speaker. Dr. Victor will introduce the topic of network analysis.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Workflow and Analysis of Political Network Data in R<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>This brief presentation focuses on workflow priorities and analytical strategies for applying social network tools to political data. Using the example of a working project on political party networks, I show how one can gather campaign finance data and reshape it to construct relational networks between political actors. Using tidyverse packages for management, and network analysis packages, such as statnet and igraph for visualization, I talk about how to manage, visualize, and analyze political data as relations, rather than as individuals.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jennifernvictor\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/jennifernvictor<\/a><\/p> <p>Website:<\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.
