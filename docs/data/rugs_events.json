In this talk I will discuss the fundamentals of building a web application using HTML/JavaScript/CSS, and how those fundamentals are used to build web applications in Shiny using R, using examples I have created in both environments. For anyone who wants to understand website structure or get the most out of their Shiny app, I hope this talk will shed some light!<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Amy Tzu-Yu Chen (@amy17519), Data Scientist at System1<br/>Title: Data Science Reporting: Tips and Tricks for useRs<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>We (data practitioners) spend most of time working on data analysis and model development but we often forget that it is as important to advocate and maintain model health, especially in a production environment. Building data science reports ahead of time can help. In this talk, let's talk about how to make useful data science reports for data scientists and business stakeholders. In this talk, we will first walk through what data science reporting means and how it is different from BI and general-purpose dashboards. Next, we explore different options for producing data science reports in a \"loud\" and clear way for data scientists and other technical and non-technical business stakeholders. Throughout the talk, I will introduce some useful R packages and tricks for building your own reports.<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>Timeline:<br/>6:30: Socializing<br/>7:00-8:00: Talks<br/>8:00: Socializing<\/p> <p>Address:<br/>Room 115/116<br/>USC<br/>2001 N.

If you're interested in taking it, please submit an application at the link below! We aim to meet the needs of a broad group of people across campus and in the community, so we implemented an application that asks for department/lab affiliation.<\/p> <p>Please apply here, details also below! <a href=\"https://registration.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/events/datalab-data-carpentry-workshop-2019/\" class=\"linkified\">https://registration.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/events/datalab-data-carpentry-workshop-2019/<\/a><\/p> <p>Data Carpentry Workshop with R<br/>Dec. 7, 2019, 10 a.m. - Dec. 8, 2019, 6 p.m.<br/>Contact - Please email [masked] or [masked] if you have any questions.<\/p> <p>Location - DataLab Classroom (Shields Library room 360). Directions<br/>Data Carpentry develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience, and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly apply skills learned to their own research. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems. We will be covering the Data Carpentry Ecology lessons because they are generally applicable to researchers who aim to do data analysis in R. We will cover data management and organization, manipulating, summarizing, and plotting data in R. For more information, please visit our workshop website.<\/p> <p>Who: The course is aimed at graduate students and other academic researchers.<br/>You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.<\/p> <p>Learners must attend both workshop days (Dec 7-8, 2019 from 10am - 6pm each day).<\/p> <p>Cost: $10. If the registration fee is a hardship please contact [masked] or [masked] as limited financial aid is available.<\/p> <p>Application deadline is 22 November 2019 at 5pm. Acceptance notices will be sent on 26 November 2019. Accepted individuals have until 2 December 2019 to register, after which their spot will be given to individuals on the waitlist and they will no longer be able to register.<br/>Requirements: Participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed below).<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: Everyone who participates in Carpentries activities is required to conform to the Code of Conduct. This document also outlines how to report an incident if needed<\/p> <p>Accessibility: We are committed to making this workshop accessible to everybody. The workshop organizers have checked that:<\/p> <p>The room is wheelchair / scooter accessible.<br/>Accessible restrooms are available.<\/p> <p>Materials will be provided in advance of the workshop and large-print handouts are available if needed by notifying the organizers in advance. If we can help making learning easier for you (e.g. sign-language interpreters, lactation facilities) please get in touch(using contact details below) and we will attempt to provide them.<\/p> <p>Registration closes on: Nov. 22, 2019<\/p> ",

What is the impact of containers and containerization on the work of data scientists? How does the average R User use these technologies?<br/>This CRUG meetup will attempt to answer these questions.<\/p> <p>1) Containers for Data Scientists - Troy Hernandez - 6pm<\/p> <p>Troy will give a brief introduction to containers, images, orchestration, and microservices. He will then lay out 3 popular use-cases for data scientists using containers.<\/p> <p>2) The Rocker Project - Dirk Eddelbuettel - 6:15pm<\/p> <p>As usual, Dirk was ahead of the curve. He started the Rocker Project (Docker Containers for the R Environment) with Carl Boettiger in June of 2014. After 5 years the project has over 200 forks and 1000 stars on Github, and over two million downloads on Docker Hub.<br/><a href=\"https://www.rocker-project.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rocker-project.org/<\/a><\/p> <p>CRUG is thrilled to have Dirk present the Rocker project, a little of its history, and will then do a demo of a couple of his favorite applications of Rocker containers.<\/p> <p>3) Rocking Kubernetes - Ray Buhr - 7pm<\/p> <p>Ray has been using Rocker containers in production since 2017. In a prod environment, container images are scaled up to 10s, 100s, or 1,000,000s of deployed containers. That kind of scale requires some management/orchestration: Enter Kubernetes (k8s).<\/p> <p>Ray will take a Shiny app running locally and show you how to run it on k8s in the cloud. He will also discuss some considerations for working with data science container workloads in production environments.<\/p> <p>###############################################<\/p> <p>As usual, IBM is sponsoring the meetup and providing food and beverages.

Będzie technicznie, będzie dogłębnie, ale zawsze w przyjaznej STWURowej atmosferze.<\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Wprowadzenie do Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI):<\/p> <p>Modele Bayesowskie są bardzo interesującą propozycją, m.in. dlatego, że rezultatem ich działania<br/>jest rozkład prawdpodobnieństwa, a nie punktowa estymacja.<br/>Niestety bardzo często uczenie i wnioskowanie w tych modelach jest bardzo kosztowne obliczeniowo.<br/>Problem nasila się wraz ze złożonością modelu i ilością danych.<br/>W prezentacji zaczniemy od szybkiego wprowadzenia do probabilistycznych modeli graficznych.<br/>Następnie pokazana zostanie trudność infernecji i sposoby aproksymacji.<br/>Praktyczne przykłady regresji i clusteringu zostaną pokazne przy użyciu biblioteki pyro.ai, która bazuje na popularnym PyTorchu.<\/p> <p>A missing values tour in R -- with a special focus on parameter estimation:<\/p> <p>Imagine you are solving a linear regression but there are a lot of missing values in your design matrix, how can you deal with so many \"NA\"? The trouble may be caused by survey non-responses, lost records or machine failures.<br/>Classical packages performing estimation would let you ignore all the lines with missingness, as a result, much information would be lost. A more reasonable method to handle this problem, is modifying an estimation process so that the method can be applied to incomplete data. For example, one can use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimate despite missing values.<br/>Another popular choice is imputation, followed by classical regression procedure on imputed dataset. In this presentation, I will talk about different types of missing data, review several imputation methods and demonstrate how to estimate parameters based on EM algorithm with R.<\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Bio naszych prelengentów:<\/p> <p>Michał Kurtys jest Data Scientistem pracującym w firmie Infermedica.

    "description": "<p>Methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN), or simply “Deep Learning”, are recently gaining more and more popularity in the Data Science industry. They might seem overwhelming for those who never tried to use them, however, the truth is that the basic theory behind it is not that hard to understand. You might be surprised that the simplest neural network is just a linear function. You also might be surprised that learning how to create a Deep Learning model does not require a PhD in math related subject.<\/p> <p>With recent frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras the effort needed to build a DNN is similar to the effort needed to build any other Machine Learning model.<\/p> <p>On this practice oriented workshop you will learn the basics of how DNN work and you will implement a simple one by yourself using the Keras framework in R. We will work on a very simple, yet real world example to showcase the mechanics that powers Deep Learning. We will predict the rent price of an apartment based on its characteristics using the publicly available data originating from AirBnb.<\/p> <p>The instructors Mikołaj Olszewski and Mikołaj Bogucki are both experienced Data Scientists and the founders of idash.pl, a startup which provides Data Science training.

There are various reasons why missing data may occur, including survey non-response, unavailability of measurements, and lost data. In this presentation, I will first share my experience on how to do parametric estimation with missing covariates, based on likelihood methods and Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Then I will focus on recent results of variable selection in high-dimensional settings with missing observations among the covariates. To address this relatively understudied problem, we propose a new synergistic procedure – adaptive Bayesian SLOPE – which effectively combines the SLOPE method (sorted l1 regularization) together with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO method. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of power, FDR and estimation bias under a wide range of scenarios. Finally, we analyze a real dataset consisting of patients from Paris hospitals who underwent a severe trauma, where we show excellent performance in predicting platelet levels.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Wei Jiang is currently pursuing PhD degree in Statistics at Ecole Polytechnique, France.

(Explained through using tidymodels, Plumber, and Shiny) - Presented by Josiah Parry<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Old Town Road, is it hip-hop or country? With its initial release, Lil Nas X declared it a country song. Billboard, the industry standard for ranking songs, artists, and albums eventually intervened making a bold statement that the song is not country and would from there forth be classified as hip-hop.<\/p> <p>This serves as the basis for a case study to illustrate the process of developing a sophisticated model and productionizing it using contemporary tools in the R ecosystem. This is done by developing an ensemble model that classifies between country or hip-hop based on its lyrics and audio features. I then explore productionizing the R model by creating a plumber API and a shiny application which are subsequently hosted on RStudio Connect.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Josiah Parry's interests include social science, politics, espresso, data science, and music.

    "description": "<p>Abstract: In a multimodal virtual environment (VE) that incorporates a number of senses, i.e., visual, auditory, and touch or haptic, data can be made tangible along with its visual presentation. Variables can be represented as haptic glyphs of different shapes, sizes, and other physical properties such as friction. Audio feedback helps further exploration of the data. However, an effective mapping across different modalities is a challenging task; what is visually accessible by sighted people, may cause information overload if being accessed via touch by the blind or visually impaired (VI). While working on different modalities, equivalent design continues to be emphasized. This pilot study addresses challenges associated with the use of glyphs in multivariate data presentations and identifies the optimum multimodal platform. The result of this pilot study demonstrates that glyphs can be successfully used for presenting multivariate data in a multimodal VE. This glyph-based multimodal presentation makes information available to the blind and VI in a semantic-aware environment. A multimodal VE also enriches the experience of the sighted users.<\/p> <p>Profile of Speaker: Shamima Yasmin, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Eastern Washington University.

    "description": "<p>By: John Snyder<\/p> <p>Interpreting the effects of individual variables from flexible machine learning models such as random forests or neural networks can be a difficult task. Typically, the flexibility of these methods tends to obfuscate these effects in favor of superior predictive performance. This tradeoff can often leave the data scientist wondering how their inputs are working for them to achieve their predictive accuracy.<\/p> <p>Visualization techniques such as Partial Dependence(PD), Individual Conditional Expectation(ICE) and Accumulated Local Effect(ALE) plots exist to recover some of the global interpretability we would get with a parametric model such as regression. These techniques frequently shed valuable insights into how the features relate to the target variable and make explaining results much easier.<\/p> <p>This month, I will first provide a brief background on why these types of procedures are valuable additions to a data scientist's analytical toolkit. Then, I will discuss the practical usage of the Interpretable Machine Learning(iml) R package, which provides a suite of functionality for analyzing any black box machine learning model. Specifically, we will discuss how to create and interpret PD, ICE, and ALE plots.<\/p> <p>The meetup will be in The Showroom in the CIC building at 20 South Sarah Street, St. Louis, MO 63108.

In 2017 it was rebranded to accommodate other under-represented groups such as LGBTQI, minority ethnic groups, and people with disabilities. The task force is organised as a core team plus a number of sub-teams that focus on particular tasks. One of these is a Teaching Team covering methodology, materials and workshops designed for under-represented groups. In this talk I will describe a workshop particularly intended to increase the number and visibility of women, people of colour and LBGTQ+ individuals in the scientific coding community.

This is roughly my motto of continuous improvement and I'd like to share with the MelbURN community, a collection of learnings that I have acquired over the past few years. Whether it is following the DRY principle, or vowing to never write a for loop again, or learning to prepare recipes and bake them in R, a lot of things I have learnt have made me feel a lot better about how problems are tackled. Unlike other talks where you might learn about a particular package or technique, this talk will introduce you to some of the ways in which you can think about and be better at writing R code.<\/p> <p>Kaushik Lakshman is a data scientist and a massive fan of R. He works at Betfair where he uses R to analyse the incredibly rich and extensive betting exchange data, to create data products and create business value using data science.

In this presentation Lyndon will draw on his experience of teaching R to hundreds of academics and business professionals (and thousands of students) to discuss tips, tricks, and things to consider when introducing and teaching your colleagues how to use R. This will include different approaches to teaching and supporting colleagues, some useful tools and resources, and the different needs and support that your colleagues may require.<\/p> <p>Dr Lyndon Walker is a former statistics lecturer who is now a part-time statistician for SACS Consulting - a psychometrics and organisational psychology company, founder of Veritate Data Science - an education and statistics training consultancy, and investor/advisor to Preventure - a workplace safety wearable tech startup.

Siamo piene di nuove idee!<\/p> <p>Chi siamo e a chi sono rivolti i nostri eventi?<br/>RLadies Bari è un gruppo locale che si rifà a RLadies Global (<a href=\"https://rladies.org/about-us/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rladies.org/about-us/<\/a>), un’organizzazione internazionale non-profit con circa[masked] membri in 46 diversi paesi del mondo. Lo scopo dell’organizzazione è di promuovere diversità ed equità di genere nella comunità di utenti di R.<\/p> <p>Se utilizzi, o vorresti imparare ad utilizzare R, questo è il gruppo giusto! Tutti sono benvenuti gratuitamente, previa registrazione a , ed hanno la possibilità di imparare in un contesto amicale e di supporto. Ci sono anche occasioni di mentorship per condividere le proprie conoscenze come speakers. Queste opportunità sono preferenzialmente rivolte a donne e minoranze.<\/p> <p>Il prossimo evento<br/>Cosa imparerai?<br/>Attraverso una breve introduzione ai sistemi di version control, come Git e GitHub, imparerai come utilizzare questi strumenti per rendere il tuo lavoro più efficiente ed evitare errori che potrebbero costarti giornate intere di programmazione. NB: questi sistemi non si limitano al mondo di R ma sono diffusissimi tra programmatori e data scientists che utilizzano i più svariati linguaggi di programmazione.<\/p> <p>A seguire, parleremo di RMarkdown, un formato di file che permette di creare reports in Word|PDF|HTML contenente sia testo scritto (i.e., plain text) che codice di programmazione. Questo è estremamente utile quando devi condividere il tuo lavoro con altri colleghi o supervisori. Imparerai a utilizzare RMarkdown attraverso una session pratica per capire le potenzialità di questo formato e vedere come creare reports personalizzati per le tue esigenze.<\/p> <p>Negli ultimi 30 minuti faremo networking per conoscerci meglio. IC406 ha gentilmente deciso di offrire ai partecipanti snacks e bibite per rendere questo momento sociale più piacevole (se avete allergie importanti, scriveteci a [masked]).<\/p> <p>Cosa devi portare con te?<br/>• Volontà e curiosità per imparare!<br/>• Rispetto e pazienza verso gli altri partecipanti secondo il codice di comportamento di RLadies (<a href=\"https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/<\/a>)<br/>• Un laptop con installata una versione recente di RStudio Desktop (qui trovate l’ultima versione: <a href=\"https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Contatti:<br/>Sara Iacozza [masked]<br/>Giovanna de Vincenzo [masked]<br/>Francesca Lamontanara [masked]<\/p> <p>Ringraziamo IC406 per supportarci e sponsorizzarci per l'evento!<\/p> ",

However, it is not perfect. To improve the developer experience, consolidate functionality, and expand on the ability to be deployed, TensorFlow 2 was developed. As of September 30th 2019, TensorFlow 2 is out of alpha and has been given a full release. This talk will address the motivations behind TensorFlow 2 and how it fixes some of the pain points of its predecessor. I will also include a practical example of how to effectively develop deep learning models using some of TensorFlow 2's features.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKER<br/>Elliott is a Data Scientist at BlackSky inc., a Virginia Based Geospatial company. For the past 5 years he has worked on developing and productizing several aspects of machine learning, particularly in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing. He is always interested in what is making an impact in the world of understanding data.<\/p> <p>Outside of work he attends several local DC meetups and loves to engage with and learn from others in the field.<\/p> ",

Ha participado en otras instancias de divulgación como: la Reunión Argentina de Ecología, el Encuentro de Jóvenes Investigadores de UNL, las Jornadas de Agroecología de San Javier, entre otros.<\/p> <p>:: CHARLAS::<br/>&gt; \"El perceptrón - la forma más simple de una red neuronal.\" Por Mariana Blanco.<br/>El desarrollo de un perceptrón en R paso a paso permitirá introducirnos a los posibles modos de tejer redes neuronales.<\/p> <p>&gt; \"Insectos enredados: Aproximación al estudio de interacciones ecológicas\" por Carla Ghiglione.<br/>Las redes ecológicas describen las complejas formas en que las especies interactúan en los ecosistemas. El análisis de los sistemas ecológicos como redes ha desempeñado un papel central en el desarrollo de la ecología como ciencia. Las redes se pueden agrupar en tres clases, en función de los tipos de organismos e interacciones involucradas: redes tróficas, redes hospedero-parasitoide y redes mutualistas. Las redes mutualistas comprenden las interacciones que son beneficiosas para ambas partes (por ejemplo, redes planta-polinizador y planta-dispersor). Las interacciones han tenido un papel central en la evolución de la biodiversidad terrestre y son el sostén de la diversidad y el funcionamiento de las comunidades naturales.<br/>En los últimos años estás herramientas han pasado de ser investigación pura a investigación aplicada, por ejemplo, se han aplicado en el contexto de la restauración del hábitats, el estudio de invasiones de especies exóticas, el manejo del pastoreo, el control biológico de plagas, la conservación de especies, entre muchas otras.<\/p> <p>:: PÚBLICO ::<br/>El espacio es limitado, por lo que les agradecemos su comprensión.

You might know about how to create static dataviz with R and ggplot2, but there's a whole zoo of htmlwidgets for creating interactive charts, maps, networks and more without learning any JavaScript. Add Shiny to the mix and you can create interactive web applications completely in R.<\/p> <p>But something we often leave out of this conversation is how to make data truly accessible and reproducibly available for the future. Martin will tie together interactive dataviz, Shiny and their work at our R-Ladies Meetup to support an end-to-end reproducible Open Data workflow.<\/p> <p>• About Martin: Martin started learning R on May 29th 2015 to prepare for their role in IT Services at University of Oxford where they lucked out on internal funding to setup the \"Interactive Data Network\" (idn.it.ox.ac.uk), which supports Oxford researchers in creating interactive dataviz of Open Data using Shiny and htmlwidgets. Since founding the IDN, Martin has created several R training courses for LinkedIn Learning and as of 2019 is a full time freelance R consultant and trainer - they're also a die hard reproducible research evangelist.<\/p> <p>• Installation requirements:<br/>Please have the following installed on your computer before this workshop (or come early and we'll help you with installation):<br/>- R<br/>- RStudio<\/p> <p>Run the following command in the R console to make sure you have the appropriate packages installed:<\/p> <p>install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"leaflet\", \"highcharter\", \"rmarkdown\", \"shiny\", \"fivethirtyeight\", \"sf\", \"rnaturalearthdata\")<\/p> <p>• Schedule<br/>5:45-6 -- Installation help, R Tour (please come early for help getting set up with R if you need it!)<br/>6-6:30 -- Food and drinks, Intros &amp; Announcements<br/>6:30-7:30 -- Workshop by Martin<br/>7:30-8:00-- Socializing/Networking/Hanging out/Chillin'<\/p> <p>Q: Are men welcome to attend this event?<br/>A: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor.

Come to learn and meet new people in cosy and warm atmosphere :)<\/p> <p>FIRST TALK:<br/>Our first speaker is Shihan Du. She has a PhD in applied econometrics, recently graduated from Copenhagen Business School, and is now working as a part-time researcher at China-Europe Productivity Center.<\/p> <p>Shihan's presentation is about advanced regression frameworks on decomposition techniques to analyze reasons for customer retention. Shihan will show one of her PhD projects - the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and decomposition based on conditional quantiles(non-linear), performed on individual-level data from Statistic Denmark. Principal component analysis (PCA) will also be briefly discussed at the end of the presentation.<\/p> <p>SECOND TALK:<br/>Our second speaker is Peer Christensen, who has a backround in linguistics and cognitive science. While working towards a PhD, he became interested in pursuing a career as a data scientist and spent much time learning R and Python. Peer recently started working at Saxo.com where he finds new ways of leveraging customer and product data to create insights.<\/p> <p>Predicting customer churn is a special case of binary classification, where standard measures of predictive accuracy are misleading when true positive predictions (churn = yes) are more important than true negatives (churn = no).<\/p> <p>Peer will show some of his ongoing work using R and the H2O autoML framework to train and evaluate multiple models in terms of their usefulness in a real-world use case.<\/p> <p>SAVE THE DATE!:<br/>When: December 5<br/>Time: 17:30 - 19:30<br/>Where: Niels Brock<br/>Bispetorvet 3<br/>1167 Copenhagen<\/p> <p>See you all soon!<\/p> <p>Regards,<br/>RLadies CPH<br/>Ivana, Shihan, Peer, Sharon<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Every Monday the R for Data Science (R4DS) releases a new dataset on their GitHub that has been tamed, but does not always adhere to “tidy” data principles. This dataset will come from an article with an interesting plot. Our goal is to take a look at the raw data, and generate either a copy of the original plot or a novel take on the data! You can obviously use whatever techniques you feel are appropriate, but the data will be organized in a way that tidyverse tools will work well!<\/p> <p>We will come together and work in teams helping each other solve this weeks TidyTuesday challenge. TidyTuesdays are a great way to improve R skills and get involved in the community!<\/p> <p>* To participate in TidyTuesday, you need to do a few things *<\/p> <p>Create and save an image of a plot from R<br/>- Save the code used to recreate your plot (include data tidy steps!)<br/>- Submit the plot and code on Twitter<br/>- Use the #TidyTuesday hashtag (you can also tag me @thomas_mock)<br/>- Browse other submissions and like/comment on their work!<\/p> <p>However, that might seem like a lot! So at minimum please submit your plot with the hashtag #TidyTuesday.<\/p> <p>* Rules for TidyTuesday *<\/p> <p>We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts to participate, but be mindful of a few things:<\/p> <p>- This is NOT about criticizing the original authors. They are people like you and me and they have feelings. Focus on the data, the charts and improving your own techniques.<br/>- This is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow #RStats practitioners! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like other’s posts and help promote the #RStats community!<br/>- The data set comes from the source article or the source that the article credits. Be mindful that the data is what it is and Tidy Tuesday is designed to help you practice data visualization and basic data wrangling.<br/>- Use the hashtag #TidyTuesday on Twitter if you create your own version and would like to share it.<br/>- Include a picture of the visualisation when you post to Twitter.<br/>- Include a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to Twitter. Comment your code wherever possible to help yourself and others understand your process!<br/>- Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with someting simple! - Make something quick, but purposeful!<br/>- Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Opening the black box is a fertile area of research today. It is apparent to anyone who has ever worked on a machine learning project that in order to realise a wide spread acceptance delivering a high accuracy model is not enough. Stakeholders are demanding transparency in how and why an algorithm is making specific predictions. A variety of approaches can be used to shed light on how algorithms make their decision: from creating alternative and more transparent algorithms that can compete with the black-box one to using robust statistical techniques. During this talk we will explore different methods for unboxing the black-box model, their pros and cons and how I have used them in TripActions.<br/>We will cover the following topics:<br/>1. Importance of human interpretable machine learning and criteria for model interpretation methods.<br/>2. Challenges and limitations of traditional techniques for model interpretation<br/>3. Hands-on example on the latest model interpretation frameworks on a supervised learning example. Using the iml package we will cover permutation importance, SHAP and LIME.<\/p> <p>This workshop is brought to you by Teodora Vrabcheva. :)<\/p> <p>PROGRAM<br/>------------------<br/>[masked] Welcoming :)<br/>18.30- 18.50 Introduction to R-Ladies &amp; Tripactions<br/>18.50- 19.30- Workshop part 1<br/>19.30- 19.45 Break<br/>19.45- 20.30 Workshop part 2<br/>20.30- 21.30 Socialising<\/p> <p>ABOUT TEODORA<br/>--------------------------<br/><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodora-vrabcheva-8b841826/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodora-vrabcheva-8b841826/<\/a><\/p> <p>My name is Teodora and I am a data scientist with background in statistics.

One way to address this issue is to use a geo experiment: a quasi-experiment that measures the causal impact of a marketing intervention. It's similar to an A/B test but instead of assigning individuals randomly to control and treatment groups, geographic regions are used to define the groups. I will give an introduction on how we use geo experiments at trivago to test the effectiveness of our marketing investments and explain how the tests are set up and analyzed in R.<\/p> <p>My Loan Tong is a data analyst at trivago.

In this collection Justice Ginsburg discusses gender equality, the workings of the Supreme Court, being Jewish, law and lawyers in opera, and the value of looking beyond US shores when interpreting the US Constitution. Throughout her life Justice Ginsburg has been (and continues to be) a prolific writer and public speaker. This book’s sampling is selected by Justice Ginsburg and her authorized biographers Mary Hartnett and Wendy W. Williams, who introduce each chapter and provide biographical context and quotes gleaned from hundreds of interviews they have conducted.<\/p> <p>Witty, engaging, serious, and playful, My Own Words is a fascinating glimpse into the life of one of America’s most influential women and “a tonic to the current national discourse” (The Washington Post).<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

The first part of this talk will cover the process I took to create the animations in R, mainly focusing on the gganimate R package but covering other supplementary tidyverse functions. The second part of this talk will be on the knowledge gained from these animations, most of which confirm our intuition about basketball. Hopefully, after this talk, I inspire the audience to go out and look for interesting data to work on.<\/p> <p>Enhance your Shiny applications with interactive charts, tables, maps and more! - Bethany Yollin:<\/p> <p>This presentation will highlight several R libraries that enable Shiny developers to leverage the power of Javascript--no web development experience required.<br/>The presentation will be accompanied by live demos and fully-reproducible code that can be repurposed for your data visualization needs.

    "description": "<p>The study of financial markets has attracted some of the brightest mathematicians, statisticians and psychologists over the past decades. Statistical methods to forecast returns, risk and build portfolios have been heavily researched, implemented and used within that industry. Equally, the technical pitfalls of these methods have been shown from identification vs forecasting to causation vs correlation, and transparency vs complexity of models.<\/p> <p>I will explore some of the major elements of quant (Data Science) used in finance, and their potential applications and lessons for other industries, specifically industry and government profiling citizens for loans, insurance and potential criminal activity. Focusing specifically on how these models function, their explainability, their tilts (eg ‘bias’ that has been talked about), and how misunderstood they can be in a social-contract context.<\/p> <p>Dr Michael G. Kollo<\/p> <p>Mike is an investment executive, a writer, a speaker and a self-confessed ‘translator’ for technical topics to wider audiences. Michael gained his PhD in Finance from the London School of Economics (LSE) in the UK, before joining a suite of sophisticated institutional asset managers (Blackrock, Fidelity and Axa) where he led research teams and spoke globally on applying quantitative (data science) techniques in asset management, machine learning and AI in society, the future of work and applications of alternative data. More recently, Michael moved back to Australia, joining the super industry as a leader in quantitative finance, and establishing the quantitative team for HESTA ($50bn fund). Michael continued to keep touch with academia, holding the Chief Examiner for Corporate Finance title at LSE for a decade, and teaching Masters of Finance courses at Imperial College (rated as the top lecturer), and NYU. He is a published author in the application of machine learning to investing, a contributor to WEF AI / Fintech panel, and a highly respected member of the quantitative community in both the UK and Australia. More recently, he started his own consultancy focusing on application of AI in financial services, as well as a global podcast (The Curious Quant) with a focus on the wider implications of AI in society. Michael enjoys good intellectual banter, philosophy, psychology and mixed martial arts.<\/p> <p>Come grab some pizza, mingle with the illuminati of the Canberra Data Science community, and hear a fantastic talk!<\/p> ",

For this event please plan on sharing a couple of slides about your own R use case, whether it is for personal or academic/professional projects. We will plan on everyone presenting their slides, saving some time for questions at the end of each presentation. I'm thinking each presentation would last 5-10 minutes (depending on how many attendees we have), making up a 2 hour total duration meeting. Because of the nature of this meeting please be sure to RSVP ahead of time through Meetup, and please add the topic of your presentation (and maybe a short summary) in the comments. Feel free to be creative here. There is no pressure to have something that is conference level polished, we are just hoping to showcase how R is being used by Rladies in the greater Denver area. Based on what is presented, we can hopefully brainstorm some additional topics of interest for future meeting workshops/presentations.<\/p> <p>Feel free to reach out with any questions and pass along this announcement to more “RLadies”. We (Meghan Sposato and Gina Reynolds are co-organizing) hope many can make it to this first meeting and future meetings! 😊 Unfortunately Gina cannot make this meeting, but we will hopefully record the meeting so that she can watch it another time. I am planning on setting up a Zoom call for this meeting for those Coloradans who would like to contribute and/or watch in remotely.<\/p> <p>Meghan<\/p> ",

Firstly, I will give you an overview about statistical modelling in non-life insurance pricing and its specialties. How can modern machine learning challenge the good old GLM world? What is the role of ML interpretability and explainability in this challenge? I will illustrate the ideas on a large real world motor claims data set.<br/>In the second part I’d like to share some thoughts on model-agnostic measures of interaction strength. How can they be used to efficiently measure overall interaction strength per input variable? How can shortcomings in current partial dependence related measures be mended?<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Michael Mayer is an enthusiastic statistician and R programmer working as non-life pricing actuary for “Die Mobiliar”, one of the most traditional and successful insurance companies in Switzerland. Since finishing his PhD at the University of Bern in 2008, Michael has worked as biostatistician, predictive modeler, statistics consultant as well as University lecturer. He is the author of three CRAN packages.<\/p> ",

The observations may have many features, importantly including labels of reasonably well-defined *stages* of the sales process. Salesfore conveniently exports such observations in easy to analyze form. Viewed through the right kind of lens, models like this look a bit like classical survival models. A friend of mine and I build some nice<br/>models along these lines. The first part of my talk briefly discusses such models.<\/p> <p>Part II<br/>In order to make the models easy to use, we designed a shiny app. In order to make the app available to our clients, at least in beta form, we deployed it with Shinyproxy (and also Docker and Nginx), a tool that makes deploying Shiny apps pretty easy to do. I'll discuss this delightful deployment process in this 2nd part.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>With the release of the R Keras package (<a href=\"https://keras.rstudio.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://keras.rstudio.com/<\/a>) (by JJ Allaire and Francois Chollet) at the end of 2017 / beginning 2018 the topic of artificial neural networks and especially deep learning in R became red-hot within the R community.<\/p> <p>„Deep Learning in R” will be a series of workshops during which you will learn how to use Keras/Tensorflow to solve different deep learning problems using Feedforward, Convolutional, and Recurrent Neural Networks. During workshops we will go through problems like image classification, object localization/detection, image segmentation, dimensionality reduction, time series forecasting, various NLP tasks and more. We will also talk about interpretability of Machine/Deep Learning models using LIME and DALEX packages.<\/p> <p>In our first workshop we will introduce Keras and Tensorflow and we will show how to build Feedforward Neural Network.<\/p> <p>After workshop we will have some pizza and drinks :)<\/p> <p>Requirements:<\/p> <p>Please make sure to bring your laptop including an up to date R version, RStudio and install `keras` package:<\/p> <p>```<br/>library(keras)<br/>install_keras() # CPU version<br/># install_keras(tensorflow = \"gpu\") # GPU version (recommended)<br/>```<br/>For more info about Keras/Tensorflow installation go to: <a href=\"https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/reference/keras/install_keras/\" class=\"linkified\">https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/reference/keras/install_keras/<\/a><\/p> <p>Participants should know basics of Machine Learning like linear and logistic regression, MSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, overfitting etc. They should also know basics of programming in R.<\/p> <p>During workshops unfortunately there will be no internet connection so participants have to download scripts and datasets before meeting: [LINK COMING SOON]<\/p> ",

This talk will delve into why open source software is so important and discuss the role of corporations as stewards of open source software. I'll also talk about how RStudio is structured and organized to pursue its mission of creating open source software for data science.<\/p> <p>J.J. Allaire is a software engineer and entrepreneur who has created a wide variety of products including ColdFusion, Open Live Writer, Lose It!, and RStudio.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>*** Data, visualization, and designing with AI ***<\/p> <p>Recent progress in machine learning has raised a series of urgent questions: How can we train and debug deep learning models? How can we understand what is going on inside a neural network? And, perhaps most important, how can we design systems that serve people best? We'll show a series of examples from the People+AI Research (PAIR) initiative at Google--ranging from data visualizations for researchers, to tools for medical practitioners, to guidelines for designers--that illustrate how thinking carefully about data can lead to better tools, more effective design, and help humans and AI work together.<\/p> <p>Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg are pioneers in data visualization and analytics. Their research has helped shape the field, and the systems they've built are used daily by millions of people. Fernanda and Martin are co-leaders of Google's PAIR (People + AI Research) initiative, which focuses on making AI technology broadly accessible and reflective of human values. Their prior work at Google has appeared on the Google search page, on YouTube, and in mission-critical internal data analytics tools.<\/p> <p>Before joining Google, at IBM Research, the two created the ground-breaking public visualization platform Many Eyes, which introduced visualization to millions of users worldwide. Viégas and Wattenberg are also known for visualization-based artwork, which has been exhibited in venues such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York, London Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Whitney Museum of American Art.<\/p> <p>-----------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Thanks to trivago for hosting &amp; sponsoring this edition of the Düsseldorf R User Group Meetup.

Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must.<\/p> <p>The second edition is updated with the addition of two new chapters, 10 color plates, and a new foreword by renowned geographer H. J. de Blij. One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps.<\/p> <p>To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color.<\/p> <p>\"Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space.\"—Scientific American<\/p> <p>\"A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted. It shows how map makers translate abstract data into eye-catching cartograms, as they are called. It combats cartographic illiteracy. It fights cartophobia. It may even teach you to find your way. For that alone, it seems worthwhile.\"—Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times<\/p> <p>\". . . witty examination of how and why maps lie. [The book] conveys an important message about how statistics of any kind can be manipulated. But it also communicates much of the challenge, aesthetic appeal, and sheer fun of maps. Even those who hated geography in grammar school might well find a new enthusiasm for the subject after reading Monmonier's lively and surprising book.\"—Wilson Library Bulletin<\/p> <p>\"A reading of this book will leave you much better defended against cheap atlases, shoddy journalism, unscrupulous advertisers, predatory special-interest groups, and others who may use or abuse maps at your expense.\"—John Van Pelt, Christian Science Monitor<\/p> <p>\"Monmonier meets his goal admirably. . . . [His] book should be put on every map user's 'must read' list. It is informative and readable . . . a big step forward in helping us to understand how maps can mislead their readers.\"—Jeffrey S. Murray, Canadian Geographic<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

Heather Nolis is a Machine Learning Engineer at T-Mobile. Jacqueline Nolis is the Principal Data Scientist at Nolis, LLC.

After the presentations there will be more social time!<\/p> <p>David Hall and Katie Jolly:<br/>Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive applications straight from R. The Ookla Data Science team hosts frequently used fact-finding tools and RMarkdown reports in a custom-built Shiny deployment. In the first half of the meetup, Ookla's Data Science team will discuss some of the challenges with building a limited feature version of Rstudio Connect then provide a functionality demo.<\/p> <p>Heather Nolis (Machine Learning Engineer at T-Mobile) and<br/>Jacqueline Nolis (Principal Data Scientist at Nolis, LLC):<br/>Making machine learning models is a core part of a data scientist’s job, but that work will only be well-received by executives if they can understand the models. The AI @ T-Mobile team has been lucky enough to get funding and people for our projects by convincing vice presidents to trust our work using fun, interactive Shiny demos with T-Mobile style and branding. In this talk we’ll cover our process of creating Shiny demos, the tools we use to make them look T-Mobile magenta, and the technology we use to quickly deploy them (spoiler, it involves Docker). We’ll also show off a few of the interactive demos we made with some audience participation.<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you at this sure to be fantastic meetup!<\/p> <p>Please email/message Ellis Hughes if you have ideas for future Meetups you would like to see or organize.<\/p> ",

Hence, there is often a conflict between accuracy and interpretability. We want the most accurate models but don’t want to sacrifice interpretability. In this talk, I discuss this conflict and some new methods in Machine Learning for interpreting ANY predictive model so you do not have to sacrifice predictive accuracy.
