Group (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/<\/a>) and will be co-hosted by the Skåne useR!

Group (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/StockholmR/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/StockholmR/<\/a>).<\/p> <p>[Abstract]<br/>The {brms} package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using Stan, a C++ package for performing full Bayesian inference (see <a href=\"https://mc-stan.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://mc-stan.org/<\/a>). The formula syntax is very similar to that of the {lme4} package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p>[Bio]<br/>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany). He is the author of the R package {brms} and member of the Stan Development Team. Previously, he studied Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen (Germany) and did his PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. He has also worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University (Finland).<\/p> ",

And rightfully so — it is super exciting and can be mind-bending at times. However, in the past 3.5 years, I have realized that it's all nice and stuff but unless you have the basics covered, your awesome recommending engine won't do much for your product. So I have worked with my stakeholders to understand our consumers and how we can build a product that suits their needs - and maybe even makes their life a little bit better. I will talk about how to measure the success of a software product through real-life examples, and how to deal with stakeholders used to listening to their gut - or fixated on building a complex model for a simple task.<\/p> <p>### Registration<\/p> <p>Registration link: <a href=\"https://x-europe-with-anna-szell.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://x-europe-with-anna-szell.carrd.co/<\/a><br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>WATCH OUT!

Many tools exist to quantify and compare abundance levels or composition of bacterial communities in different conditions. The sequencing reads have to be denoised and assigned to the closest taxa from a reference database. By providing a complete workflow in R, we enable the user to do sophisticated downstream statistical analyses, whether parametric or nonparametric. We provide examples of using the R packages dada2, phyloseq, DESeq2, ggplot2, structSSI and vegan to filter, visualize and test microbiome data. We also provide examples of supervised analyses using random forests and nonparametric testing using community networks and the ggnetwork and ggraph packages.<\/p> <p># Speaker<br/>Trained in the French school of Data Analysis in Montpellier, Susan Holmes has been working in non parametric multivariate statistics applied to Biology since 1985. She has taught at MIT, Harvard and was an Associate Professor of Biometry at Cornell before moving to Stanford in 1998. She created the Thinking Matters class: Breaking Codes and Finding patterns and likes working on big messy data sets, mostly from the areas of Immunology, Cancer Biology and Microbial Ecology. Her theoretical interests include applied probability, MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov chains), Graph Limit Theory, Differential Geometry and the topology of the space of Phylogenetic Trees. She wrote the book Modern Statistics for Modern Biology with Wolfgang Huber from EMBL and teaches the material as a crash course (BIOS221) regularly every year. Her current focus is improving the statistical analyses and reproducibility of data in perturbation studies of the Human Microbiome.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning. <a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jumping_uk\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/jumping_uk<\/a><br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

I enjoy taking part in hackathons for social good. I live and work in North Yorkshire with my husband, my son and my dog called Chewie.<\/p> <p># Description<br/>PowerBI is a free business intelligence tool by Microsoft. With little codes (or sometimes no code at all), performing tasks such as connecting, cleaning, manipulating and visualising data can be pretty amazingly quick and easy. This introductory tutorial will walkthrough PowerBI workflow from connecting data using R script connector, visualising your analysis, sharing your result and finally operationalising your R script – all by using PowerBI as the authoring tool.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<br/><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

I reached this point about two years ago, when I transitioned from ecological research to the world of eCommerce fraud prevention. My calls to read_csv became scarcer as I came to rely more and more on databases. In this talk, I’ll demonstrate how I incorporate R and SQL into my daily workflow, aided by features in RStudio IDE . I’ll also discuss our company’s “riskiconn” package for handling database connections and queries, and how this package was a key tool during our migration to a new database service.<\/p> <p>rstudio::global(2021) preview / Presented by Curtis Kephart<br/>Curtis Kephart is an Economist and Community Organizer @ RStudio<br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>rstudio::global(2021) is a free, virtual event on all things R &amp; RStudio.

It starts on January 21 at 8:00 AM Pacific time.<\/p> <p>Learn more about rstudio::global and register at global.rstudio.com.<\/p> <p>####<br/>Malcolm Barrett<br/>Zen and the Art of Package Development<\/p> <p>R packages make it easier to write robust, reproducible code, and modern tools in R development like usethis make it easy to work with packages. When you write R packages, you also unlock a whole ecosystem of tools that will make it easier to test, document, and share your code. Despite these benefits, many believe package development is too advanced for them or that they have nothing to offer. A fundamental belief in Zen is that you are already complete, that you already have everything you need. I’ll talk about why your project is already an R package, why you’re already an R package developer, and why you already have the skills to walk the path of development.<\/p> <p>Bio<br/>Malcolm is a Clinical Research Data Scientist at Teladoc Health, an epidemiologist, an R developer and also an organizer for the Los Angeles R Users Group. Malcolm is the author of several R packages, including ggdag and precisely. Previously, he was an intern at RStudio and spent two years of service in AmeriCorps. In 2013 and 2014, while serving in AmeriCorps, Malcolm lived in the Zen Center of New York City, where he is still a student.<\/p> <p>####<br/>Rongkui Han<\/p> <p>Title: Probability Calibration in Multiclass Classification<br/>In classification problems, the accurate estimation of posterior probabilities of the class labels is highly valuable. Not all the machine learning algorithms can provide good estimates of the class probabilities. Some, such as SVM, do not provide any estimates. As a result, probability calibration is needed. A popular calibration method for binary classification is Platt scaling, a parametric method that assumes a logistic model for class probability given the classification score generated by SVM.<\/p> <p>Other non-parametric methods for probability calibration in the binary case include isotonic regression, Bayesian binning into quantiles (BBQ), ensemble of linear trend estimation (ELiTE), and Jittering the training data, along with over/under-sampling (JOUS).<\/p> <p>Here, we introduce a polynomial extension of Platt scaling and a new probability calibration method based on k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN). We compare the performance of the aforementioned existing methods and our new methods in the context of multiclass classification, using real and simulated datasets.<\/p> <p>#### Kenneth Lee<br/>Impact of US government interventions during COVID 19 pandemic: seen through mobility<\/p> <p>Mobility is one of the potential factors in contributing to the spread of COVID-19. In this talk we describe our work to estimate the effect of state-wide policies on mobility signals at a county-level. We do so by using a regression discontinuity design to compare the difference in mobility signals before and after interventions. Also, we examine the correlation between the magnitude of the effect and the county-level demographic data. Based on assumptions, we have found that a mandatory COVID19 policy tends to be more effective in the areas with a large population, a small percentage of people in poverty, a high percent of people with education backgrounds, and a low unemployment rate.<\/p> ",

Please see event details below:<\/p> <p>Details<br/>[About]<br/>This event is organized by the Oslo useR! Group (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-useR-Group/<\/a>) and will be co-hosted by the Skåne useR!

Group (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/StockholmR/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/StockholmR/<\/a>).<\/p> <p>[Abstract]<br/>The {brms} package provides an interface to fit Bayesian generalized (non-)linear multivariate multilevel models using Stan, a C++ package for performing full Bayesian inference (see <a href=\"https://mc-stan.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://mc-stan.org/<\/a>). The formula syntax is very similar to that of the {lme4} package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p>[Bio]<br/>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany). He is the author of the R package {brms} and member of the Stan Development Team. Previously, he studied Psychology and Mathematics at the Universities of Münster and Hagen (Germany) and did his PhD in Münster about optimal design and Bayesian data analysis. He has also worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science at Aalto University (Finland).<\/p> ",

Il loro obiettivo è supportare le donne e le minoranze di genere sottorappresentate nella data science e data analytics. Le donne sono le assolute protagoniste dei loro webinar e vogliono dar loro voce e spazio per raccontare le loro esperienze, ambizioni e obiettivi. Vogliono creare un luogo metafisico di supporto e condivisione. Si concentriano in particolare sul mostrare alle persone che, anche in campi non tradizionalmente legati al mondo della data science, forti competenze sull’analisi dei dati e una mentalità data-driven possono essere una risorsa inestimabile.<\/p> ",

A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more.<br/>In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs.

Zoom password will be sent out the day of the event.<\/p> <p>Always look on the bright side of plots<br/>Everyone who creates visualizations in R is bound to make mistakes that prevent their plots from looking as they should. Sometimes, these mistakes create beautiful \"accidental aRt\", though other times they're just plain frustrating. Either way, however, there's something to be learned. This talk will draw on years of watching both the ggplot2 issue tracker and the @accidental__aRt Twitter account to highlight some common plot foibles and explain what they can teach us about how ggplot2 works.<\/p> <p>rstudio::global is a free, virtual event on all things R &amp; RStudio.<br/>It's hosted over 24-hours – giving people at different timezones a number of options to conveniently engage – with a number of talks and community-engagement events we hope you'll enjoy.

The formula syntax is very similar to that of the {lme4} package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p>[Bio]<br/>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany).

She is passionate about using innovation and technology to tackle issues related to climate change and food security. She obtained her Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from The Ohio State University, and is currently a Senior Air Quality Scientist at Ramboll, San Francisco. She is originally from Chennai, India.<\/p> <p>Abstract: Several communities in the Bay Area are disproportionately impacted by poor air quality. Some cities have established community air monitoring programs to monitor air pollution concentrations in real-time to determine impacts to communities from various pollution sources in the area. Varsha’s talk will focus on a novel methodology developed in her work at Ramboll to determine distinct sources of emissions in the area using a combination of ambient air monitoring data, machine learning, and air dispersion modeling. The talk will focus on the results of the study and how the study provides communities an independent way to monitor emissions from nearby pollution sources.<\/p> <p># NASA Climate Data<br/>Speaker: Alyssa Columbus<br/>NASA Datanaut<\/p> <p>Bio: Alyssa Columbus is a member of the Spring 2018 Class of NASA Datanauts, and her technical guides, tutorials, and articles have been featured by leading organizations, including Forbes, Microsoft, and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Columbus is the founder of R-Ladies Irvine and is an advocate of technological innovation, open-source software, and diversity in STEM.<\/p> <p>Abstract: NASA offers thousands of open datasets to the public that document everything from planets and stars to oceans and atmospheres. This presentation will give a brief overview of open NASA climate data and how anyone can get involved with NASA's climate-related citizen science projects.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

Have a messy dataset and don't know where to start? Seen beautiful visualizations on Twitter and want to make your own?<\/p> <p>If you’ve answered ‘yes’ to at least one of these questions, fear no more! In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with. You will be able to create new columns and summary tables, subset interesting rows or columns, and combine and reshape dataframes. We will also dive into ggplot, one of the best tools for creating great-looking bar charts, scatterplots, and more!<\/p> <p>This is (currently) a five-part series, aimed at total beginners and/or people with some experience in base-R or tidyverse who are looking to freshen up or expand their skills. Feel free to join at any point, we will briefly review the previous topic at the beginning of each session.<\/p> <p>January 20th {Part 1}: The R &amp; R-Studio ABCs (packages, files, data types &amp; basic data exploration)<br/>February 17th {Part 2}: Tidy data &amp; introduction to data wrangling (tibbles, renaming, reordering, subsetting)<br/>March 17th {Part 3}: Data wrangling with dplyr (new columns, if-else statements, summary tables, joining dataframes)<br/>April 21st {Part 4}: Introduction to visualizations with ggplot (line graphs, bar charts, scatterplots, histograms, and more!)<br/>May 19th {Part 5}: Advanced topics in wrangling and ggplot (pivoting, ggplot style options, etc.)<\/p> <p>Please install R and R-Studio before joining: <a href=\"https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html<\/a><\/p> <p>Image by the amazing @allison_horst: <a href=\"https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations<\/a><\/p> ",

In some cases these can create cascading reactivity (the horror). The goal of `reactor` is to diagnose these reactivity problems and then plan unit tests to avert them during app development, making it a less painful and more robust experience.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>/federico<\/p> ",

Many tools exist to quantify and compare abundance levels or composition of bacterial communities in different conditions. The sequencing reads have to be denoised and assigned to the closest taxa from a reference database. By providing a complete workflow in R, we enable the user to do sophisticated downstream statistical analyses, whether parametric or nonparametric. We provide examples of using the R packages dada2, phyloseq, DESeq2, ggplot2, structSSI and vegan to filter, visualize and test microbiome data. We also provide examples of supervised analyses using random forests and nonparametric testing using community networks and the ggnetwork and ggraph packages.<\/p> <p># Speaker<br/>Trained in the French school of Data Analysis in Montpellier, Susan Holmes has been working in non parametric multivariate statistics applied to Biology since 1985. She has taught at MIT, Harvard and was an Associate Professor of Biometry at Cornell before moving to Stanford in 1998. She created the Thinking Matters class: Breaking Codes and Finding patterns and likes working on big messy data sets, mostly from the areas of Immunology, Cancer Biology and Microbial Ecology. Her theoretical interests include applied probability, MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov chains), Graph Limit Theory, Differential Geometry and the topology of the space of Phylogenetic Trees. She wrote the book Modern Statistics for Modern Biology with Wolfgang Huber from EMBL and teaches the material as a crash course (BIOS221) regularly every year. Her current focus is improving the statistical analyses and reproducibility of data in perturbation studies of the Human Microbiome.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<br/><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<\/p> ",

Dr. Kim will introduce the topic of reproducible workflows for research. Although the term \"research\" brings thoughts of academic research to mind (for example, a dissertation or thesis), these ideas are also directly applicable to other workflows that professional data scientists and analysts encounter in their daily work. Whatever your role, we hope you will come ready to enhance your understanding and appreciation of reproducible workflows and feel empowered to apply this framework in your research.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Reproducible Workflow When Writing a Research Paper<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: College and Ph.D. students who do empirical work often underestimate the problems associated with reproducibility. Certain lessons should be shared for those entering the research phase, which will help not to struggle or waste time later. From setting up an R project to using renv, I discuss some of the most important things that new researchers should be mindful of when starting a new data analysis project.<\/p> <p>Bio: I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Government at American University. I received my Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 2020. My research interests are in American Politics and Political Methodology, focusing on political behavior (registration/turnout/campaign contributions), working with large voter files and Federal Election Commission datasets.

    "description": "<p>Estos últimos meses no han sido fáciles :( Por ello, los distintos capítulos de RLadies Chile (Santiago, Valparaíso, Concepción y Talca) decidimos reunirnos para compartir distintas experiencias acerca de cómo R nos ha ayudado a sobrellevar este período: nos permitió concluir proyectos importantes, nos ayudó a desconectarnos de todo lo que estaba pasando al explorar nuevos desafíos, encontramos nuevas formas de colaborar y compartir en nuestros espacios de trabajo y comunidad.<\/p> <p>&gt; El programa de esta sesión:<\/p> <p>- Stephanie Orellana: \"30 días con R\"<br/>- Alejandra Tapia Silva: \"Explorando algunas funciones sonoras con R\"<br/>- Riva Quiroga: \"Cómo certificarse como instructora de RStudio y hacer amigas en el intento\"<br/>- Sara Acevedo: \"Una Shiny app en reemplazo de pizarra\"<br/>- Macarena Valenzuela: \"Usando R para terminar una tesis de doctorado en pandemia\"<\/p> <p>Luego de las presentaciones tendremos un espacio para preguntas y comentarios. Aprovecharemos este evento para presentar también nuestra programación de actividades del primer semestre.<\/p> <p>&gt; ¿Qué necesito para participar?<\/p> <p>Lo primero, es leer nuestro nuestro código de conducta. Es requisito para asistir estar de acuerdo con él: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish<\/a><br/>Lo segundo, es asegurarte de que puedes utilizar la aplicación Zoom en tu computador. El día del taller te enviaremos la contraseña para unirte (chequea ese día que el mensaje no se haya ido a la carpeta de spam).<\/p> <p>¡Nos vemos!<\/p> ",

If you would like to attend the event but the registration fee would put a financial strain on you, please reach out to [masked]. There are a limited number of complimentary tickets available.<\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundational knowledge to effectively use some powerful regression models used by data scientists. When data are collected on the same subjects repeatedly over time (for example, in clinical trials or cohort studies) or under different conditions (for example, in a designed experiment), the measurements within the same individual are modeled as having correlated values. At the workshop, we will consider several models that can be employed to model a normally distributed response variable. The models that we will consider are: random slope and intercept (mixed-effects) model and generalized estimating equations models with unstructured, autoregressive, compound symmetric (exchangeable), and independent working correlation matrices. All models will be run in R version 4.0.3.<\/p> <p>The course will be structured as follows. For each part, we will first discuss the theory, then work through an example. After that, the participants will work in small groups in break-out rooms to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material. All the files and Rstudio will be made available to the participants.<\/p> <p>We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be setup and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.<\/p> <p>The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book “Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications” (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/<\/a>), CRC Press, 2018.<\/p> <p># About the Instructor<br/>Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB).

    "description": "<p>part 2 of the Generalized Linear Models workshop organized via birminghamR.<\/p> <p>In part one, Bodo Winter gave an introduction to linear models and generalized linear models. This second workshop will introduce participants to mixed models, which are otherwise known as multilevel models or sometimes also hierarchical linear models. These models are crucial for dealing with cases of non-independence, such as when multiple data points are collected from the same individual, or from the same school, district, institution, country, or any other grouping variable. After a brief conceptual introduction, the workshop gives a quick tutorial on how to use the lme4 and afex packages to fit a generalized linear mixed effects model in R.<\/p> <p>Please feel welcomed even if you didn’t make it to the first session as Bodo will begin with a very quick recap of part one anyway.<\/p> <p>In case you want to see what was covered in part one, here is a link to a recording of the first session: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/35CwxVz\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/35CwxVz<\/a><\/p> <p>A repo with access to the hands-on materials will be distributed closer to the date of the workshop.<\/p> ",

We will discuss how it has impact on areas ranging from routine healthcare, to the development of novel treatment strategies and diagnostic paradigms. I will focus on a key aspects that brought surprises during the last few years, when the expectation of the impact of AI was quite different from the direction reality took. Examples will include medical imaging, prediction of individual treatment response, and the exploratory identification of novel disease phenotypes in large-scale data.<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://automation-or-exploration.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://automation-or-exploration.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Georg Langs, Chief Scientist, contextflow GmbH - www.contextflow.com; Associate Professor, Director Computational Imaging Research Lab, Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna - www.cir.meduniwien.ac.at<\/p> <p>Georg Langs is chief scientist at contextflow GmbH, and heads the Computational Imaging Research Lab at the Medical University of Vienna.

His research is focussed on the intersection between mathematical modelling, data science, and networks in order to provide understanding of various complex systems. This has resulted in research describing the spreading of memes on social media, applying ideas from control theory to financial systems, and even identifying characteristics of successful competitors in Fantasy sports. You can find more information at <a href=\"https://www.joeyobrien.ie/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.joeyobrien.ie/<\/a><\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>Arising from the desire for spectators of sporting contests to obtain more enjoyment, Fantasy sports have become increasing popular in recent years. These sports involve competitors to create virtual teams that score points based upon the statistical performances of the physical athletes. Given the virtual structure of these contests there exists an array of data regarding competitor actions available online as a result of their digital traces. In this talk we will look at some techniques within the R programming language that may be used to parse this data via webscraping procedures. We will then describe one such example study focussing specifically on the Fantasy Premier League, the fantasy equivalent of the top division within English soccer. In particular we will consider visual techniques from the Tidyverse suite of packages that allow a descriptive story regarding the science of success behind those competitors who perform well in the game to be developed.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<br/><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

The formula syntax is very similar to that of the lme4 package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p># Speaker<\/p> <p>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany).

If you would like to attend the event but the registration fee would put a financial strain on you, please reach out to [masked]. There are a limited number of complimentary tickets available.<\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundational knowledge to effectively use some powerful regression models used by data scientists. When data are collected on the same subjects repeatedly over time (for example, in clinical trials or cohort studies) or under different conditions (for example, in a designed experiment), the measurements within the same individual are modeled as having correlated values. At the workshop, we will consider several models that can be employed to model a normally distributed response variable. The models that we will consider are: random slope and intercept (mixed-effects) model and generalized estimating equations models with unstructured, autoregressive, compound symmetric (exchangeable), and independent working correlation matrices. All models will be run in R version 4.0.3.<\/p> <p>The course will be structured as follows. For each part, we will first discuss the theory, then work through an example. After that, the participants will work in small groups in break-out rooms to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material. All the files and Rstudio will be made available to the participants.<\/p> <p>We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be setup and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.<\/p> <p>The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book “Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications” (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/<\/a>), CRC Press, 2018.<\/p> <p># About the Instructor<br/>Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB).

Compared to the Rgui program included with the R installer, RStudio offers a clean, organized way to write code, view results, and organize their projects. However, RStudio offers many more features to help you out. In this presentation we're going to do a deep dive into the 'Code' menu which has many tools for writing cleaner, more reusable code and making certain tedious tasks easy. The end goal is to write better, more reusable code with less work.<\/p> <p>Kenneth Fairchild is a Senior Consultant at Sawtooth Software where he specializes in Conjoint market research surveys.

In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with. You will be able to create new columns and summary tables, subset interesting rows or columns, and combine and reshape dataframes. We will also dive into ggplot, one of the best tools for creating great-looking bar charts, scatterplots, and more!<\/p> <p>This is (currently) a five-part series, aimed at total beginners and/or people with some experience in base-R or tidyverse who are looking to freshen up or expand their skills.

We're back in February with part 2 of the Generalized Linear Models workshop by Bodo Winter.<\/p> <p>In part one, Bodo Winter gave an introduction to linear models and generalized linear models. This second workshop will introduce participants to mixed models, which are otherwise known as multilevel models or sometimes also hierarchical linear models. These models are crucial for dealing with cases of non-independence, such as when multiple data points are collected from the same individual, or from the same school, district, institution, country, or any other grouping variable. After a brief conceptual introduction, the workshop gives a quick tutorial on how to use the lme4 and afex packages to fit a generalized linear mixed effects model in R.<\/p> <p>Please feel welcomed even if you didn’t make it to the first session as Bodo will begin with a very quick recap of part one anyway.<\/p> <p>In case you want to see what was covered in part one, here is a link to a recording of the first session: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/35CwxVz\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/35CwxVz<\/a><\/p> <p>A repo with access to the hands-on materials will be distributed closer to the date of the workshop.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hi, everybody!<br/>We hope that you and your family are doing well. We are super excited to have Jill de Ron, PhD student at the psychological methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA) to bring you a workshop on Network analysis in R!<\/p> <p>DESCRIPTION<br/>-------------------<br/>We can use networks to provide insights into a variety of settings: A network connecting our Facebook friends gains understanding in our social structure; a human contact network gains insight into disease transmission; and a network of public transport lines informs us about the most central subway stations. In these examples, the relationships between components in the network are known. But in a lot of other cases, the relationships between components are unknown and are what we are interested in. For example, when we want to investigate the relationships between different personality traits. Network psychometrics makes it possible to estimate relationships between a large number of variables. Once you estimated a network, you can perform network-based statistics that give you information about the network’s local and global characteristics. In this workshop, you will learn how to estimate, analyze and interpret (psychological) network models. After a short introduction to network models, we will follow by a tutorial on analyzing data with network models.<\/p> <p>PROGRAMME<br/>----------------------<br/>18.30- 18.45 Virtual Welcome<br/>18.45- 20.30 Workshop and Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>ABOUT JILL<br/>-------------------<br/>I am a PhD student at the psychological methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA). My research is concerned with computational models of anxiety disorders and (formal) theory construction in psychology. I have a master’s degree in both Behavioral Data Science and Psychology. During my master programs I have been teaching assistant for the network analysis course at the UvA.<\/p> <p>PREREQUISITES<br/>-----------------------<br/>A basic knowledge of R is recommended. To join the tutorial, please install the bootnet package and the qgraph package.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct. Anyone who violates this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, meetup membership or other condition. We are emphatically queer and trans-friendly. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn.<\/p> ",

But, if you type in \"white girls,\" the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about \"why black women are so sassy\" or \"why black women are so angry\" presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society.<\/p> <p>In Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.<\/p> <p>Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance-operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond-understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance.<\/p> <p>An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

So how do you get your R scripts to run? In this talk I hope to inspire lone data scientists on all the ways you can run your Rscript in the cloud. I cover some simple and more advanced use cases for running R in the cloud. I also talk about cooperating with IT for maximum results.<\/p> <p># Speaker<br/>I'm a maker, I love to build useful (machine learning) tools for people and I love sharing what I learned. I have been working in researcher, data scientist and machine learning engineer roles for the past years. I want to make it easy, convenient and simple for everyone to run their R work in the cloud.

She previously worked at DataCamp, where she built and ran their experimentation analytics system, and at Etsy, where she worked with their search team.<\/p> <p>Dr. Jacqueline Nolis is a data science leader with over 15 years of experience in leading data science teams and projects at companies ranging from DSW to Airbnb. She has a PhD in Industrial Engineering, and for fun Jacqueline likes to use data science for humor - like using deep learning to generate offensive license plates.<\/p> <p>Authors Emily and Jaqueline will read selections from their book and discuss why parts were personally meaningful and tell stories from their pasts that ended up shaping the narrative. You’ll learn about the overarching themes from the book to help people excel in their data science careers, as well as tips that can be practical for people at all career levels. After Emily and Jacqueline discuss their book, the floor will open so anyone can ask their data science career questions.<\/p> ",

Enter flexdashboard, which allows you to create a dashboard using a RMarkdown file. In this short workshop, we’ll build a flexdashboard by exploring and visualizing metrics for a pre-specified open dataset. We’ll learn the basics of flexdashboard while brainstorm dashboard design ideas, calculate and display our metrics, and discuss possible deployment options.<\/p> <p>Bio: Kaelen is a data scientist at Medidata Solutions where they work as an R programmer on the microservices team. They've also worked at Spring Health, DataCamp, HERE Technologies, and have done a fair amount of R and Shiny consulting on the side. Kaelen has been at various times in their life a film theorist, preschool teacher, test prep tutor, videographer, and nanny before getting a MS in Biostatistics from LSU Health Sciences Center in 2016 and starting work as a statistician and data scientist.

But what happens<br/>if, with repeated use, they start to grow impatient and would like it to<br/>run faster, or if the userbase increases and the app cannot easily cope<br/>with the growing demand? We are suddenly in the realm of performance<br/>optimisation. But what does this entail? In this introductory talk, I<br/>will mention some principles and tools to help you along this journey:<br/>from how you should think about performance improvements before you even<br/>get started, to how you should test, measure or boost performance with<br/>tools such as {shinyloadtest} or {profvis}, or caching and more.<\/p> <p>----------<\/p> <p>Dean Attali (<a href=\"https://deanattali.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://deanattali.com/<\/a>) is a Shiny Consultant based in Canada.
