Questo metodo è utilizzato soprattutto per l’analisi del sito web aziendale, in quanto traccia l’esperienza degli utenti sul sito e mostra le fasi che lo portano al raggiungimento di una conversione oppure di un qualche obiettivo per l’azienda, come la registrazione alla newsletter e la generazione di lead.<\/p> <p>In questo evento, Sara spiegherà come la Funnel Analyses può aiutare a determinare il punto in cui gli utenti abbandonano la pagina e non completano il percorso che porta alla Conversione. In questo modo l’analisi può essere utilizzata come punto di partenza per capire il motivo per cui gli utenti diminuiscono tra una fase e l’altra e apportare così delle modifiche in grado di ridurre il tasso di uscita e, a sua volta, aumentare il tasso di conversione.<br/>Useremo R-studio per le analisi, creeremo un file R-markdown per produrre un report e riceveremo un piccolo aiuto da un amico - la libreria RSQLite - in modo da poter incorporare il codice SQL nelle nostre analisi e report.<\/p> <p>SPEAKER<\/p> <p>Questo evento online sarà tenuto dalla (nostra co-fondatrice) dott.ssa Sara Iacozza (<a href=\"https://www.saraiacozza.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.saraiacozza.com/<\/a>). Sara è attualmente Chief Data Officer e Behavioral Insight Researcher presso Digital Attitudes a Milano. Possiede un dottorato di ricerca presso il Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics nei Paesi Bassi.<\/p> <p>ENGLISH<\/p> <p>Every time you enter a website there are many flows of events that are initiated and can be followed through by a visitor. Imagine you land on the homepage of an e-commerce or a digital academic journal. You are looking for a specific item, that can be a T-shirt or a published paper, and need to navigate through menus and sub-menus before you land on the page you were looking for. What happens most of the time is that only a small portion of visitors achieve their goal of buying the T-shirt or reading the searched paper. Funnel analysis can help you spot where visitors are leaving your website, so you can optimize it and increase conversions.<\/p> <p>In this event, Sara will explain how you can analyze funnels to identify key traffic sources and spot significant drop-off points. You’ll also learn how to combine funnel reports with more analytics insight, so you can share strategies that can improve the experience of users. We will use R-studio for the analyses, we’ll create a R-markdown file to output a report, and we will get a little help from a friend - RSQLite library- so that we can embed SQL code in our analyses and report.<\/p> <p>SPEAKER<br/>This online event will be led by Dr Sara Iacozza (<a href=\"https://www.saraiacozza.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.saraiacozza.com/<\/a>). Sara is currently a Chief Data Officer and Behavioural Insight Researcher at Digital Attitudes in Milan, Italy, having previously completed her PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in The Netherlands.

    "description": "<p>Please welcome our speaker, Dr. Stephana Julia Moss, PhD Epidemiologist, with the Calgary Critical Care Research Network.<\/p> <p>A systematic review and meta-analysis is a scientific exercise that impacts healthcare and health policy. Readers of systematic reviews and meta-analyses may be patients, clinicians, administrators, or policymakers and therefore possess a wide range of skill in understanding research terms. It is important that authors of systematic reviews and meta-analyses make every effort to guide readers in making the best use of results in myriad clinical contexts and settings. Dr. Moss will present a critical appraisal of the methodological approach of a published systematic review and meta-analysis that culminates with a brief tutorial that compares the statistical approach to meta-analysis in STATA and R.<\/p> <p>Dr. Moss received her BSc in Biochemistry from the University of Calgary, her MSc in Pharmacology from the University of Alberta, and her PhD in Epidemiology from the University of Calgary. Her most important scholarly contributions to date have centered on how to best partner with citizens in research. Thought leaders and funding agencies have been advocating with limited success for years for researcher-citizen partnerships to maximize the relevance and impact of scholarly work. Dr. Moss’s work epitomizes the value of this conceptual approach.<\/p> <p>Please join us and learn together.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>¡Desde RLadies Bariloche les invitamos a comenzar con el estudio en grupo del libro R para Ciencia de Datos (versión traducida al español de R for Data Science) de Hadley Wickham (el creador de Tidyverse y varios paquetes más!). El libro es de libre acceso en <a href=\"https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/\" class=\"linkified\">https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/<\/a> ¡Está muy bueno!<\/p> <p>• Nos juntaremos de forma virtual una vez cada 15 días para avanzar con la lectura y comprensión del libro y los scripts. Cada encuentro será guiado por uno o dos integrantes del grupo.<\/p> <p>• En el primer encuentro discutiremos el capitulo número 3 “visualización de datos” (¡Qué bueno, empezamos con gráficos con ggplot2 ) <a href=\"https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/visualizaci%C3%B3n-de-datos.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/visualizaci%C3%B3n-de-datos.html<\/a> Es necesario llegar a la reunión con el capítulo previamente leído y trabajado. Quienes no leyeron la introducción del libro aún: adelante, es corta, y les dará un panorama de lo que iremos estudiando. En la reunión de organización vimos un panorama de la introducción.<\/p> <p>• En base a la encuesta de horarios que hicimos, hemos definido tres grupos de trabajo con distintos horarios. ¡ATENCIÓN! ¡Por favor, anotarse solo en uno de los tres! AHORA ESTÁS EN EL MEETUP DEL GRUPO 3, DE JUEVES DE 18 A 20.<\/p> <p>• ¡Importante! Ni bien se inscriban en el meetup, entren a los ajustes de su perfil y verifiquen tener activas las notificaciones, no sólo del meetup en general, sino del grupo RLadies-BRC en particular (figuran abajo del todo en notificaciones por correo electrónico) para poder recibir luego el enlace para conectarse y otras notificaciones relacionadas al evento.<\/p> <p>• Quienes se inscriban al meetup y si aún no se sumaron, van a recibir más adelante un enlace para sumarse al espacio de trabajo de slack que es exclusivo para el estudio del libro y que será nuestra principal vía de comunicación. Si nunca lo usaron y/o necesitan ayuda para familiarizarse, escríbannos y les damos una orientación rápida.<\/p> <p>• Necesitamos uno o dos voluntarias o voluntarios para guiar el capítulo número 3. Interesadxs nos lo pueden comunicar por el slack o al correo [masked]. Cuanto antes, mejor.

Members of the group can use code nyhackr for a 20% discount at <a href=\"https://rstats.ai/gov/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstats.ai/gov/<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Conversations during the meetup are encouraged in the monthly-meetup-chat channel in the nyhackr slack: <a href=\"https://nyhackr.org/slack.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://nyhackr.org/slack.html<\/a><\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Before we even dust off R and start to do analysis, we sometimes have to wrangle ridiculous quantities of data. The promise of cloud vendors is that it is easy with the cloud. The reality is often quite different. Recently, JD was faced with the problem of a recurring workflow that involves joining 35 billion records into a many-to-many join resulting in 75+ billion records and then collapsing that down to summary data. He grabbed a small team of developers and set out on a multi-week journey to figure out how to solve this workflow while minimizing runtime and costs. Some of the most important findings weren't just \"which platform to use?\" but, more importantly, \"how should a team think about this class of problem?\" This presentation will be light on R, and heavy on Amazon Web Services but will be of interest to anyone who's wondering what it takes to move billions of rows of data around efficiently.<\/p> <p>About JD:<br/>JD Long is co-author of The R Cookbook 2nd Edition and founder of the Chicago R User group. His day job is helping to build risk solutions at a global reinsurance company which involves using a suite of tools that include not only R but also Python, and a host of AWS tooling. JD lived in the NYC area for a number of years and now lives in Richmond, Virginia with his wife, daughter, and dog.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM America/New_York and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before.

    "description": "<p>Sharing the third meetup of the TunisR OnePackagePerMeetup series.<br/>This time with a focus on some of the powerful data visualization packages that are available in the programming language R.<\/p> <p>TunisR will be hosting Dean Attali and Veerle Van Leemput who will walk through the {colourPicker} and {bs4Dash} Packages in R (meetup link)<\/p> <p>➡️ About them:<\/p> <p>Dean Attali (<a href=\"https://attalitech.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://attalitech.com/<\/a>) is not a typical R useR - he doesn't know any data science and can't even run a t-test. He has a background in Computer Science and worked in Silicon Valley before falling in love with R. Today Dean is known as The Shiny Guy; he works as a shiny consultant, and if you've done any work with shiny, you probably ran into him. He wrote many popular packages for shiny users, such as {shinyjs}, {timevis}, {shinyalert}, and {colorpicker}, which is what he'll show us today.<\/p> <p>Veerle Van Leemput (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/veerlevanleemput/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/veerlevanleemput/<\/a>) is an entrepreneur and Data Scientist who gets excited about data and programming. She is Managing Director and Head of Data Science at Analytic Health, a UK-based company that develops intelligent and accessible technology which gives organisations the tools they need to accelerate innovation in healthcare. She is an R developer with a Master’s Degree in Data Science and multiple years of experience in the pharmaceutical market. Besides programming in R (and Shiny) she also develops multiple web applications for healthcare organisations using Vue.js and Node at Analytic Health.<\/p> <p>➡️ Place: Zoom<br/>➡️ Date/Time: Thursday 11, 2021 from 7PM to 8PM Tunisian time (UTC +1)<\/p> <p>We recommend you to have a look at the convenient world clock website <a href=\"https://lnkd.in/gUAZxQM\" class=\"linkified\">https://lnkd.in/gUAZxQM<\/a> if you're struggling to find the right time according to your time zone.<\/p> <p>➡️ Description of the presentations:<\/p> <p>➖ You've just made an amazing plot in R, and the only thing remaining is finding the right colours to use. Arghhh this part is never fun... You’re probably familiar with this loop: try some colour values -&gt; plot -&gt; try different colours -&gt; plot -&gt; repeat. Don’t you wish there was a better way?<br/>Well, now there is!<br/>You might find the Plot Colour Helper from the {colourpicker} package handy (<a href=\"https://daattali.com/shiny/colourInput/\" class=\"linkified\">https://daattali.com/shiny/colourInput/<\/a>). It’s an RStudio addin that lets you interactively choose combinations of colours for your plot, while updating your plot in real-time so you can see the colour change. The {colourpicker} package also contains a colour chooser input for shiny apps.<\/p> <p>➖ You can make amazing looking R Shiny applications, especially if you use the power of templates. Templates allow you to quickly set up the bare bones of your application and make use of common web elements like headers, sidebars and controlbars. One awesome Shiny template comes from the bs4Dash package (<a href=\"https://rinterface.github.io/bs4Dash/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rinterface.github.io/bs4Dash/<\/a>). It lets you use the full power of AdminLTE, a dashboard template built on top of Bootstrap 4. During her presentation, Veerle will show you how to use bs4Dash to make your own Shiny dashboard application. She will go over the main components of the bs4Dash template and she will highlight some cool features like a built-in dark/light mode and pre-loaders. After the presentation you’re all set to leverage the power of bs4Dash yourself in your next Shiny app!<\/p> <p>In order to attend the meetup, please fill out this short form<br/>👉 <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/62y6wp9j\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/62y6wp9j<\/a><\/p> <p>You will get a Zoom link a few hours before the training session.

The study was looking to see if it was possible to identify characteristic gene variants for various clinical characteristics of patients undergoing IVF treatment. During the presentation I’m going to discuss in depth the reasons behind our choices of methods, what were the differences between them, what results were expected and what did surprise us. I will share sample of code that was used, bit of theory and a lot of visuals that helped understand the<br/>problem. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with genetic data – it won’t be necessary to understand<br/>the idea.<\/p> <p>Speaker: Krystian Zielinski<\/p> <p>Krystian is a Data Scientist in R&amp;D department at Invicta. Previously he worked in financial crime area, where his own-developed tools helped to prevent frauds. Currently he analizes genetic data searching for correlations with medical data. His tools based on AI provide core functionalities in IVF stimulation process. He is also conducting lectures Wyższa Szkoła Bankowa in Gdańsk related to Methods of Machine Learning.<\/p> ",

The link to the meeting will be visible for registered participants shortly before the beginning of the event (at the latest).<\/p> <p>----<\/p> <p>New technologies and research in the field of machine learning and deep learning methods and new ways of accessing, integrating and analyzing sensitive personal data increase the demand for solutions to be able to respect laws on data privacy and confidentiality. Fields of applications include official statistics and social sciences, financial transactions, social network activities, location trajectories, CRM, insurance data and medical records.<br/>New data protection regulations, that especially include high penalties for violating privacy, put the topic of statistical disclosure control in focus.<\/p> <p>There are a lot of different concepts to consider data privacy. To name a few: privacy preserving computation, remote execution, remote access, synthetic data, and statistical disclosure control. We focus on the latter one. Statistical disclosure control includes the measurement of the re-identification risk of persons in a data set, the anonymization of data and the measurement of the information loss after anonymization. After anonymization the data include no link to persons, and thus all the rules on privacy do no longer apply.<\/p> <p>Based on an application using the European Survey of Income and Living Condition, we show the S4 class R package sdcMicro in action. Note, that each anonymization should be done very data- and use-case specific, and an anonymization of different kinds of data (e.g. mobility data, event history data, time series, longitudinal data) needs different solutions.<\/p> <p>The audience is expected to have knowledge in base R.<\/p> <p>Further readings, resources and documents:<\/p> <p>Publications (selection):<br/>- Journal of Statistical Software: sdcMicro<br/><a href=\"https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v067i04\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v067i04<\/a><br/>- Publication about sdc app<br/><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/12/9/191/htm\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/12/9/191/htm<\/a><br/>- Online test version<br/><a href=\"https://sdctools.shinyapps.io/sdcapp/\" class=\"linkified\">https://sdctools.shinyapps.io/sdcapp/<\/a><br/>- Book on SDC in Springer<br/><a href=\"https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319502700\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783319502700<\/a><\/p> <p>Resources:<br/>- sdcMicro development on github<br/><a href=\"https://github.com/sdcTools/sdcMicro\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/sdcTools/sdcMicro<\/a><br/>- sdcMicro stable CRAN version<br/><a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdcMicro/index.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdcMicro/index.html<\/a><\/p> <p>See also:<br/>- International Household Survey Network<br/><a href=\"http://www.ihsn.org/software/disclosure-control-toolbox\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.ihsn.org/software/disclosure-control-toolbox<\/a><br/>- World Bank Group<br/><a href=\"http://surveys.worldbank.org/sdcmicro\" class=\"linkified\">http://surveys.worldbank.org/sdcmicro<\/a><\/p> ",

We collected over 7,000 open text explanations from our users on why they opted out of one of our main features. Of course, I couldn't read every answer and classify it manually, therefore I needed to use a variety of tools to make sense out of these answers and group them in informative clusters, which I would like to present today.<\/p> <p>## TALK 2 The gt Package: Introduction and Demo<\/p> <p>Speaker: Richard Iannone<\/p> <p>The gt package is table preparation package for R which makes the presentation of tabular data fairly easy. The package allows for a lot of customization.

Questo metodo è utilizzato soprattutto per l’analisi del sito web aziendale, in quanto traccia l’esperienza degli utenti sul sito e mostra le fasi che lo portano al raggiungimento di una conversione oppure di un qualche obiettivo per l’azienda, come la registrazione alla newsletter e la generazione di lead.<\/p> <p>In questo evento, Sara spiegherà come la Funnel Analyses può aiutare a determinare il punto in cui gli utenti abbandonano la pagina e non completano il percorso che porta alla Conversione. In questo modo l’analisi può essere utilizzata come punto di partenza per capire il motivo per cui gli utenti diminuiscono tra una fase e l’altra e apportare così delle modifiche in grado di ridurre il tasso di uscita e, a sua volta, aumentare il tasso di conversione.<br/>Useremo R-studio per le analisi, creeremo un file R-markdown per produrre un report e riceveremo un piccolo aiuto da un amico - la libreria RSQLite - in modo da poter incorporare il codice SQL nelle nostre analisi e report.<\/p> <p>SPEAKER<\/p> <p>Questo evento online sarà tenuto dalla (nostra co-fondatrice) dott.ssa Sara Iacozza (<a href=\"https://www.saraiacozza.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.saraiacozza.com/<\/a>).

Possiede un dottorato di ricerca presso il Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics nei Paesi Bassi.<\/p> <p>ENGLISH<\/p> <p>Every time you enter a website there are many flows of events that are initiated and can be followed through by a visitor. Imagine you land on the homepage of an e-commerce or a digital academic journal. You are looking for a specific item, that can be a T-shirt or a published paper, and need to navigate through menus and sub-menus before you land on the page you were looking for. What happens most of the time is that only a small portion of visitors achieve their goal of buying the T-shirt or reading the searched paper. Funnel analysis can help you spot where visitors are leaving your website, so you can optimize it and increase conversions.<\/p> <p>In this event, Sara will explain how you can analyze funnels to identify key traffic sources and spot significant drop-off points. You’ll also learn how to combine funnel reports with more analytics insight, so you can share strategies that can improve the experience of users. We will use R-studio for the analyses, we’ll create a R-markdown file to output a report, and we will get a little help from a friend - RSQLite library- so that we can embed SQL code in our analyses and report.<\/p> <p>SPEAKER<br/>This online event will be led by Dr Sara Iacozza (<a href=\"https://www.saraiacozza.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.saraiacozza.com/<\/a>).

In many cases, complex computer models allow analysts to explore future scenarios to advise the decision maker on appropriate policies to make. This task is often reduced to one of mathematical optimisation under uncertainty; the best policy to take is the one which maximises the expected returns.<\/p> <p>The decision making task is often difficult because (a) the computer models used take long time periods to run; (b) the models may be stochastic (exhibit random properties) and (c) these models are merely approximations to reality.<\/p> <p>I'll present an approach to dealing with these challenges in the context of maximising the performance of an offshore wind farm.<br/>---<\/p> <p>---<br/>Laura Cole, National Audit Office<\/p> <p>Title<br/>Everything you ever wanted to know about Financial Modelling at the National Audit Office but were afraid to ask<\/p> <p>Abstract<br/>The National Audit Office (NAO) is responsible for auditing £1.7tr [masked]) of government spending; we audit the financial statements of all central government departments, agencies and other public bodies, and report the results to Parliament. We are also responsible for assessing the value that this spending achieves. Using our special access rights to request almost any data from government, we produce a range of outputs, across a vast range of topics. One of these outputs is auditing financial models that underpin government spending projections.<\/p> <p>In this short presentation I will explain:<\/p> <p>What the objectives of the Modelling team are and how we collaborate with internal and external stakeholders;<br/>How we use internally collected data to decide on our model assurance approach and how we visualise this data in an RShiny app; and<br/>How analysts are involved in quality assuring outputs generated from government models.<\/p> <p>Biography<br/>In 2016 Laura graduated from Newcastle University with a PhD in Applied Mathematics, with research focusing on the Solar Dynamo. She took up a role in the Civil Service Fast Stream and worked as a statistician at the DWP and then an executive agency of HMRC. In 2019, she joined the NAO as a Senior Analyst and has lead on the Modelling team’s Data Science strategy, as well as delivering model assurance (and managing/mentoring others to deliver model assurance) on over 50 business critical models that feed into government accounts. This week marks the beginning of the next step in her career after securing promotion to Head of Modelling at the NAO. Outside of work, she enjoys participating in programming challenges (e.g. Project Euler, Tidy Tuesday) and enjoys spending time with her young family, including her cockerpoo Bailey.<br/>---<\/p> ",

Joint modelling approaches are used to study these two types of data simultaneously to assess the effect of longitudinal biomarkers on time-to-event data. The first joint modelling proposals have been based on a relationship between one single longitudinal biomarker and time-to-event data. Recently, several extensions have been developed for multivariate longitudinal and survival data, for non-linear longitudinal and survival data, to use different association structures between the longitudinal biomarker and patients` survival and for personalized dynamic predictions of time-to-event data. In this talk, we will focus on the recent developments of joint models from both frequentist and Bayesian perspective, with developed R packages.<\/p> <p>Speaker: Ipek Guler<\/p> <p>I am Ipek Guler born in Turkey in 1986, after finishing my University degree in Gazi University, Ankara, I have started to my master degree in University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain where I have specialized in applied statistical techniques. During my master studies, I had different internships in Clinical Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, IDICHUS and a spin-off company and I focused my research on longitudinal and survival data.<\/p> <p>I have worked in several research projects as a researcher in biostatistics group of University of Santiago de Compostela during 6 years, as a statistical consultant in Maimonides Biomedical Research Institute of Córdoba (IMIBIC) for 2 years and also have worked in national Covid registry data with the Spanish Internal Medicine Society (SEMI).

Even if you aren't currently dealing with big data, chances are that sooner or later you'll find yourself with a dataset that is just too big for your normal R setup to handle.<\/p> <p>At this meetup in collaboration with CopenhagenR, Rasmus Bååth, data science lead at Castle.io, will share three strategies that can be used to tackle big data in R (and python if that's your cup of tea). Three big data tools will be briefly introduced: duckDB, Spark and SnowflakeDB.<\/p> <p>The CopenhagenR meetup is ramping up again and invites you to join this event aimed at everybody working with or interested in data science.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKERS<\/p> <p>Rasmus Bååth - Rasmus is a data science lead at Castle.io, a Y combinator-backed startup building an AI-based security and fraud detection service. He's worked with big data in many different forms and knows that, while it can be a pain to handle big data, there can be great business value (and good career opportunities) knowing how to do so.<\/p> <p>--<br/>** Please ALSO register here to secure your spot **<br/><a href=\"https://gotopia.tech/events/94/sign_up\" class=\"linkified\">https://gotopia.tech/events/94/sign_up<\/a><\/p> ",

Hope to see some of you there, too!<\/p> <p>ABOUT THIS EVENT:<br/>Have you got lots of ideas of what you want to do with your data but just can’t get there yet? Over 5 sessions we will look into the basics of the statistical programming language R and how it can be applied to data visualisation and automated report generation. We cover data cleaning and pre-processing, transforming your data, displaying it in multiple formats (data table and plots), and finally tying it all together in a R Markdown file that you can save and share with your audience. We will work through multiple datasets and exercises so on conclusion of the class you can hit the ground running.<\/p> <p>WHO SHOULD ATTEND:<br/>You are new to R or feel a bit rusty with your R skills and have a keen interest in furthering your ability to manage, display and share data. Maybe you have been mainly using Excel or an off-the shelf tool like Power BI, but are frustrated by its limitations and are keen to build more advanced visuals to do your data justice. You might have a dataset or model you want to prepare outputs for and want to progress to a more powerful, efficient and streamlined process. This Masterclass can be used as an entry into R or can be used as preparation for our R Shiny Masterclasses.<\/p> <p>INSTRUCTORS:<br/>Dr. Uli Muellner (Director — IT &amp; Information Design)<br/>Crystal Johnston (Full-Stack Developer)<br/>Nick Snellgrove (Full-Stack Developer)<\/p> <p>FORMAT:<br/>5 interactive online sessions; supported by dedicated online learning plattform for asynchronous learning and interaction.<\/p> <p>COST<br/>$985 NZD (excl.

We will have the great pleasure to be monthly hosting amazing guests! For the next few months we will focus on some of the powerful data visualization packages that are available in the programming language R.<\/p> <p>We are delighted to be hosting Thomas Lin Pedersen who will walk through the tidygraph package in R (<a href=\"https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/<\/a>). Thomas Lin Pedersen is a software engineer at RStudio focusing on developing and maintaining the various packages that makes data visualisation possible in R. He is the maintainer of ggplot2 and the developer of a range of extensions such as patchwork, ggforce, and gganimate. In the spare time, Thomas makes generative art created with R using the same tools as he develops for data visualisation.<\/p> <p>➡️ Place: Zoom<br/>➡️ Date/Time: December 2, 2021 from 7PM to 9PM Tunisian time (UTC +1)<\/p> <p>We recommend you to have a look at the convenient world clock website <a href=\"https://lnkd.in/gUAZxQM\" class=\"linkified\">https://lnkd.in/gUAZxQM<\/a> if you're struggling to find the right time according to your time zone.<\/p> <p>➡️ About the workshop:<br/>Working with network data can be daunting for people used to the more classic tabular data types. The packages tidygraph and ggraph have been developed to bring some of the familiarity of dplyr and ggplot2 to working with network data with the hope that more people will be comfortable wrangling and analysing this type of data. This workshop will introduce the core concepts of network data and show how it can be tamed with the help of tidygraph and ggraph.<\/p> <p>In order to attend the meetup, please fill out this short form 👉 <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/4srp7y66\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/4srp7y66<\/a><\/p> <p>We will send you the Zoom link a few hours before the training session.

    "description": "<p>Please welcome our speaker, David Aponte, PhD Candidate in medical science at the University of Calgary.<\/p> <p>Shiny is an R framework for interacting with data through a web app. If you have complex data that is either continuously updated or big enough for people to explore for their own insights, Shiny is a fantastic library for creating visual tools to open up your data to the broader community. Shiny apps can easily be deployed to the web, allowing others to leverage your data and analyses without the fuss of installing anything or writing code.<\/p> <p>In this workshop, we will learn the basics of making a Shiny application, starting with how you can take your existing analyses and make them work with user selectable inputs. We’ll also go over some tips for making your Shiny app work efficiently and look slick. Finally, we will go over deploying your Shiny application to a live website for anyone to use.<\/p> <p>If you’d like to follow along with the workshop, make sure to download the Github repository from <a href=\"https://github.com/J0vid/CalgaryR_Shiny\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/J0vid/CalgaryR_Shiny<\/a>. The GitHub readme briefly outlines the goals of the workshop, as well as potential future topics.<\/p> <p>About the speaker:<\/p> <p>David Aponte is a PhD Candidate in medical science at the University of Calgary. His dissertation work has focused on how genetic variation produces facial shape variation in mice and humans. He has used R for a wide array of projects like measuring color patterns from image data and identifying genetic syndromes from measurements of facial shape.<\/p> <p>Please join us and learn together.<\/p> ",

And how to make a package built to last.<\/p> <p>Speakers: Alison Moss, Jake Riley, and Jess Streeter<\/p> <p>More details coming soon.<\/p> <p>Presentations:<\/p> <p>1)<br/>Alison Moss presents: dataVisEasy - seamless integration of metadata and data for easy and accurate visualizations<\/p> <p>After getting tired of running similar lines of code over and over again to make minor adjustments to heatmaps and data visualizations, I accidentally found myself writing several functions to make all that tweaking easier, eventually turning into it into a package. Now seamlessly integrating metadata into data visualizations is nice and easy and all those minor tweaks your boss asks for don’t have to be an extra source of stress.<\/p> <p>Alison just recently graduated with her PhD from Thomas Jefferson University and is now working at Rajant Health Inc as a Computational Biologist. She absolutely loves coding in R and gets way too much enjoyment out of writing and debugging functions to make data analysis and visualizations easy and consistent.<\/p> <p>2)<br/>Jess Streeter presents: Nerdify your life<\/p> <p>Learn about Spring Health's internal package, Nerdify, and how it has streamlined several internal processes across our growing data team.<\/p> <p>Jess is a Senior Data Scientist at Spring Health. She has spent her entire career working on issues around mental health. When she's not coding away, she enjoys spending time with her family, drinking good beer, and training Jiu Jitsu.<\/p> <p>Please note: We are limited to 100 attendees, so make sure to join on time if you'd like to participate in the live event. The workshop will be recorded and shared on our YouTube channel shortly after the meetup event.<\/p> ",

Webinars are back !<\/p> <p>Webinar: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC1-B2RLGwk\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC1-B2RLGwk<\/a><\/p> <p>Title:<br/>Recent developments of Joint Models for longitudinal and survival data using R<\/p> <p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Many biomedical follow-up studies aim to investigate the relationship between a repeated measurement, measured with error and time-to-event data. Joint modelling approaches are used to study these two types of data simultaneously to assess the effect of longitudinal biomarkers on time-to-event data. The first joint modelling proposals have been based on a relationship between one single longitudinal biomarker and time-to-event data. Recently, several extensions have been developed for multivariate longitudinal and survival data, for non-linear longitudinal and survival data, to use different association structures between the longitudinal biomarker and patients` survival and for personalized dynamic predictions of time-to-event data. In this talk, we will focus on the recent developments of joint models from both frequentist and Bayesian perspective, with developed R packages.<\/p> <p>Speaker: Ipek Guler<\/p> <p>I am Ipek Guler born in Turkey in 1986, after finishing my University degree in Gazi University, Ankara, I have started to my master degree in University of Santiago de Compostela, Spain where I have specialized in applied statistical techniques. During my master studies, I had different internships in Clinical Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, IDICHUS and a spin-off company and I focused my research on longitudinal and survival data.<\/p> <p>I have worked in several research projects as a researcher in biostatistics group of University of Santiago de Compostela during 6 years, as a statistical consultant in Maimonides Biomedical Research Institute of Córdoba (IMIBIC) for 2 years and also have worked in national Covid registry data with the Spanish Internal Medicine Society (SEMI).

    "description": "<p>Mark you calendars for a first-of-its-kind R-Ladies SB x Central Coast Python Meetup on December 15th!<\/p> <p>Python can be a powerful alternative/complementary language to R, and while we here at R-Ladies are certainly partial to the latter, adding another language to our data science toolkit is something we are always excited for.<\/p> <p>We have collaborated with Central Coast Python to bring you an R to Python (and vice versa) translation workshop, where we will learn to wrangle and visualize the same dataset using both languages.<\/p> <p>This event is open to R/Python enthusiasts of all skill levels!<\/p> <p>You may choose to follow along on our screens or download the required software and packages to code along on your own machines. If you do not already have R and Python installed, please be sure to do so before the event on December 15th. Find our installation instructions for R/RStudio, Python/Anaconda, and required packages on the event's GitHub README: <a href=\"https://github.com/samanthacsik/RLadiesSB-RvsPython\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/samanthacsik/RLadiesSB-RvsPython<\/a><\/p> <p>We will be available to help troubleshoot any setup issues on 12/07 from 5:30-6:30pm via Zoom: <a href=\"https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/81620992244?pwd=d2ZQTCtwZVZvU3Q4M25FN1hIM1Fxdz09\" class=\"linkified\">https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/81620992244?pwd=d2ZQTCtwZVZvU3Q4M25FN1hIM1Fxdz09<\/a>.<\/p> <p>This will be a hybrid in-person/remote event. We are excited to begin meeting/networking with our communities once again, but understand that not everyone may be comfortable attending events in person still. We will do our best to answer questions for those attending virtually, but please understand that we may be slow to respond as we navigate our first hybrid event.<\/p> <p>PLEASE NOTE: Masks are required for in-person attendance and vaccination status will be verified at the door.<\/p> <p>DIRECTIONS: This event will be held at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at 1021 Anacapa St. Our offices conveniently sit at SB city lot #8. The first 75min of parking are free and $1.50 per hour after that. Street parking is also available on the surrounding streets. Please enter the first floor office space through the side door that faces the parking lot (located on the left side of the building, if your back is to Anacapa St.).<\/p> <p>REMOTE ATTENDEES: Please join the event via Zoom <a href=\"https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/82671745133\" class=\"linkified\">https://ucsb.zoom.us/j/82671745133<\/a><\/p> <p>Banner Image Source: <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/is-python-faster-than-r-db06c5be5ce8\" class=\"linkified\">https://towardsdatascience.com/is-python-faster-than-r-db06c5be5ce8<\/a><\/p> ",

You can register using this form: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/2ejXxdk4q8oT6XkJ6\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/2ejXxdk4q8oT6XkJ6<\/a> . The hackathon will commence virtually on Thursday December 9th 2021 at 9am and conclude with virtual project presentations on December 10th at 3pm. The hackathon GitHub page (<a href=\"https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/tree/master/meetings/2021-12_hackathon\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/tree/master/meetings/2021-12_hackathon<\/a>) has more information including descriptions of the projects and the tentative schedule. The list of projects for this year’s hackathon can be found here: <a href=\"https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/blob/master/meetings/2021-12_hackathon/Project_descriptions.md\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/blob/master/meetings/2021-12_hackathon/Project_descriptions.md<\/a> .<\/p> <p>A hackathon is an event in which participants come together to build a software product during a short period of time. Here is a short article describing what you can expect: <a href=\"https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/what-is-a-hackathon/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/what-is-a-hackathon/<\/a>. Last year’s hackathon (<a href=\"https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/tree/master/meetings/2020-12_hackathon\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/pstew/biodataclub/tree/master/meetings/2020-12_hackathon<\/a>) featured 55 participants working collaboratively on 7 projects. Like last year, projects featured in this year's hackathon all have potential benefits for Moffitt.<\/p> <p>This will be a fun event and we encourage everyone to sign up! The event will be very low stakes, and we encourage friendly competition between teams. Some programming background in any language is recommended but not required. If you are not confident in your programming skills, then there may be non-programming tasks such as finding validation datasets, cleaning data, creating figures, or creating slides for the results presentation that will still allow you to participate.<\/p> <p>Please register by Monday, December 6th at 12pm or you may not be able to participate. We look forward to seeing you there!<\/p> <p>The Bio-Data Club 2021 Hackathon Organizing Committee<br/>(Anders Berglund, Rodrigo Carvajal, Jordan Creed, Guillermo Gonzalez-Calderon, Jose Laborde, Richie Reich, Paul Stewart)<\/p> ",
