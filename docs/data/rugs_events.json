    "description": "<p>LA R Users Group will have our March meeting online at <a href=\"https://usc.zoom.us/j/246443859\" class=\"linkified\">https://usc.zoom.us/j/246443859<\/a>. This our first virtual meetup!<\/p> <p>**Talk1** (25min talk, 5min Q&amp;A)<br/>Title: \"vctrs: Creating custom vector classes with the vctrs package\"<br/>Presented by: Jesse Sadler, Lecturer at Loyola Marymount University<\/p> <p>The base R types of vectors enable the representation of an amazingly wide array of data types. There is so much you can do with R. However, there may be times when your data does not fit into one of the base types and/or you want to add metadata to vectors. vctrs is a developer-focused package that provides a clear path for creating your own S3-vector class, while ensuring that the classes you build integrate into user expectations for how vectors work in R. This presentation will discuss the why and how of using vctrs through the example of debkeepr, a package for integrating historical non-decimal currencies such as pounds, shillings, and pence into R. The presentation will provide a step-by-step process for developing various types of vectors and thinking through the design process of how vectors of different classes should work together.<\/p> <p>** About Talk1 Speaker **<br/>I am a historian of early modern Europe and currently a lecturer at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. My research investigates the significance of sibling relationships and inheritance in the development of early modern capitalism. I have been using R for approximately two and a half years to analyze and visualize historical data. I am the author of two R packages that should be on CRAN shortly. The opencage package geocodes locations and is written in concert with Maëlle Salmon and Daniel Possenriede, among others. I am also writing a package called debkeepr that integrates non-decimal currencies into R through the basis provided by the vctrs package.<\/p> <p>**Talk2** (25min talk, 5min Q&amp;A)<br/>Title: “Starter Guide to R Plumber + Slack”<br/>Presented by: Emad Hasan, Founder &amp; COO at Retina<\/p> <p>In this talk, I will cover how you can use R Plumber to interact with Slack and surface analysis and data directly in Slack on demand.

In particular, there is an increased<br/>need for online tests and self tests conducted in learning management<br/>systems (such as Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, etc.), possibly also live<br/>quizzes with voting via smartphones or tablets, and maybe even classical written exams at the end of the semester.<\/p> <p>The open-source package \"exams\" for R (<a href=\"http://www.R-exams.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.R-exams.org/<\/a>) provides a one-for-all approach to automatic exams generation, tying together various open-source packages (in R and beyond). It is based on individual exercises for multiple-choice or single-choice questions, numeric or text answers, or combinations of these. The format can be either in R/Markdown or R/LaTeX containing questions/solutions with some random numbers, text snippets, plots/diagrams, R output, or individualized datasets. The exercises can be combined to exams and easily rendered into a number of output formats including PDFs for classical written exams (with automatic evaluation), import formats for various learning management systems, live voting (via ARSnova), and the possibility to create custom output (in PDF, HTML, Docx, ...).<\/p> ",

Since then, the collaborative work of authors, RStudio and R community brought an uncounted amount of improvements and custom extensions. The latter was noticed to provide functionalities for the most customized and fascinating use cases.<\/p> <p>Nowadays, in 2020 we are in a comfortable position where the creation of well-designed, client-read Shiny applications takes just a few lines! It is also easier for developers to create extensions for use cases we’ve been starving for! One of such in shinyMobile that allows to create Shiny applications designed for mobile usage!<\/p> <p>During the webinar I will describe main elements of Shiny, the concept of miniUI and the elements needed to use shinyMobile. After the introduction to details of the implementation, the plan is to show an example shinyMobile application, designed for the image classification, developed by me.<\/p> <p># Bio:<br/>Olgun Aydin finished his PhD by publishing a thesis about Deep Neural Networks. He works as a Senior Data Scientist in PwC Poland, gives lectures in Gdansk University of Technology in Poland and is a member of WhyR? Foundation. Olgun is a big fan of R and an author of the book called “R Web Scraping Quick Start Guide” , two video courses that are called “Deep Dive into Statistical Modelling with R” and “Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning with R”. An author of academic papers about the application of statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. He is passionate about statistics, new methods and always enthusiastic to share his experience with all interested in learning data science!<\/p> ",

U samoj analizi sentimenta prikupljenih tekstova oslonićemo se na Bing sentiment leksikon koji je dat u paketu {textdata}.

Konačno, primenom bejzijanskih A/B testova testitamo hipoteze o tome da li je sentiment bio pozitivniji ili ne u kontekstu vesti dobijenih pretragom za Apple, Samsung, i Huawei.<\/p> <p>Meetup je namenjen svim entuzijastima u programskom jeziku R, profesionalcima u Data Science koji žele da steknu uvid u analizu sentimenta teksta, kao i publici koju interesuje mašinska analiza teksta uopšte. Mnogi detalji na koje moramo da obratimo pažnju u razvoju pravih sistema za NLP i analizu sentimenta neće biti obuhvaćeni studijom slučaja koju smo pripremili i njima ćemo posvetiti pažnju na kraju diskusije. Cilj je, pre svega, da se zainteresovani steknu uvid u korake i principe u analizi sentimenta teksta, a R programeri dobiju kod i objašnjenje od koga mogu da počnu i uče dalje ako su zainteresovani.<\/p> <p>Predavač će biti dr Goran S. Milovanović, vlasnik konsultantske agencije DataKolektiv i Data Scientist za Wikidata u Wikimedia Deutschland.<\/p> <p>Svi materijali su već sada dostupni na GitHub-u: <a href=\"https://github.com/GoranMilovanovic/Belgrade_20200312_SentimentAnalysis_R\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/GoranMilovanovic/Belgrade_20200312_SentimentAnalysis_R<\/a><\/p> <p>----------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>The Meetup will provide an introduction to sentiment analysis of English text in the programming language R. The principles of sentiment analysis will be discussed in a mini case study of how three tech giants - Apple, Samsung, and Huawei - were represented by online media in English during the first two months of 2020.<\/p> <p>We will relly on the {newsrivr} package to search and collect the relevant news trough the Newsriver API. We will then demonstrate how to perform simple text pre-processing using {tidytext} and {dplyr}. In the sentiment analysis step itself we will rely on the Bing sentiment lexicon present in the {textdata} package. All visualizations will be produced in {ggplot2} while the report on the analysis will be reproduced in R Markdown during the meetup. Finally, we will use Bayesian A/B testing to test a set of simple hypotheses on the sentiment tone in the online media representation of Apple, Samsung, and Huawei.<\/p> <p>Lecturer: Goran S.

If you'd like to follow along and take part in the challenges, these are some of the packages you'd need.

Follow the instructions at <a href=\"https://github.com/CorrelAid/newsanchor\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/CorrelAid/newsanchor<\/a> to add your API key to your R environment (alternatively, you can specify it every time you use the package). This will allow us to analyze the news and the hot topics of the day (guess what that is). For the literature analysis, downloading of the text is done very swiftly via the gutenbergr package and I'll leave it up to you to decide which books you'd like to analyze. The janeausten package includes books by the famous British author Jane Austen. Finally, we'll see how to analyze Tweets over time and gain insights into the habits of those who tweet!<\/p> ",

    "start": "2020-03-18",
    "description": "<p>**UPDATE** We are moving this event online, at the same time and day. We will send a Zoom link for the call day prior to the event. Hope you can join us online!<\/p> <p>Dr. Erin LeDell is the Chief Machine Learning Scientist at H2O.ai, where she leads the development of an open-source, automatic machine learning (AutoML) platform. Before joining H2O.ai, she worked as a data scientist and software engineer and founded DataScientific, Inc. She’s also the founder of the non-profit Women in Machine Learning &amp; Data Science (WiMLDS.org) organization and co-founder of the R-Ladies Global organization. She received her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley where her research focused on machine learning and statistical computing.<\/p> <p>**Scalable Automatic Machine Learning in R with H2O**<\/p> <p>The focus of this presentation is scalable and automatic machine learning in R using the H2O machine learning platform. H2O is an open-source, distributed machine learning platform is designed to scale to very large datasets that may not fit into RAM on a single machine. We will provide a brief overview of the field of Automatic Machine Learning, followed by a detailed look inside H2O’s AutoML algorithm. H2O AutoML provides an easy-to-use interface that automates data pre-processing, training and tuning a large selection of candidate models (including multiple stacked ensemble models for superior model performance), and due to the distributed nature of the H2O platform, H2O AutoML can scale to very large datasets. The result of the AutoML run is a “leaderboard” of H2O models which can be easily exported for use in production. R code examples are available on GitHub for participants to follow along on their laptops.<\/p> <p>--<\/p> <p>Q: Are men welcome to attend this event?<br/>A: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor. Please contact [masked] if you have questions.***<\/p> <p>Additionally, please help us by spreading the word about R-Ladies, and by being respectful of the fact that this event is primarily for women/non-binary/female-identifying individuals.<\/p> ",

It originated with a clever student's IntroStat class final project! The research consists of 1 patent-pending statistical model for calculating the quality of a baseball pitch, 8 million Major League Baseball (MLB) pitches calculated, 12 thousand lines of R code, 15 MLB teams consulted, and 1 active Twitter handle @qopbaseball. In the first part of the presentation (~30min.), I will tell the origin story and development, with special attention given to the R work and lessons learned along the way. The second part of the presentation (~20min.) will be guided according to audience interest. I will take questions on any aspects of the project. I will have code and data on hand for demonstration. Sample data will be provided for audience explorations.<\/p> <p># Live-streaming &amp; Meeting Materials<br/>- All registered attendees will receive a Zoom link to join the meeting.

Blogdown is a popular R package developed for producing a static website from R Markdown documents. Even if you are currently using GitHub pages for your personal website, you might be interested in this talk after reading this post by Yihui (<a href=\"https://yihui.org/en/2017/06/netlify-instead-of-github-pages/\" class=\"linkified\">https://yihui.org/en/2017/06/netlify-instead-of-github-pages/<\/a>).<br/>In this talk, we’ll introduce some tips and tricks for building a personal website with Blogdown based on our own experience. This talk is expected to be a hands-on workshop (something fun and meaningful to do during quarantine). Participants would have a chance to build their own “baby” website and deploy the website online with Netlify!<\/p> <p>Preparation: It would be helpful if you register a Netlify account and master some basics about GitHub and Markdown in advance. You can be even more prepared and start to work on your own website now by following this tutorial written by Annie (<a href=\"https://annielyu.com/2020/01/12/blogdown-website/\" class=\"linkified\">https://annielyu.com/2020/01/12/blogdown-website/<\/a>).

Social media has made charts, infographics, and diagrams ubiquitous―and easier to share than ever. We associate charts with science and reason; the flashy visuals are both appealing and persuasive. Pie charts, maps, bar and line graphs, and scatter plots (to name a few) can better inform us, revealing patterns and trends hidden behind the numbers we encounter in our lives. In short, good charts make us smarter―if we know how to read them.<\/p> <p>However, they can also lead us astray. Charts lie in a variety of ways―displaying incomplete or inaccurate data, suggesting misleading patterns, and concealing uncertainty―or are frequently misunderstood, such as the confusing cone of uncertainty maps shown on TV every hurricane season. To make matters worse, many of us are ill-equipped to interpret the visuals that politicians, journalists, advertisers, and even our employers present each day, enabling bad actors to easily manipulate them to promote their own agendas.<\/p> <p>In How Charts Lie, data visualization expert Alberto Cairo teaches us to not only spot the lies in deceptive visuals, but also to take advantage of good ones to understand complex stories. Public conversations are increasingly propelled by numbers, and to make sense of them we must be able to decode and use visual information. By examining contemporary examples ranging from election-result infographics to global GDP maps and box-office record charts, How Charts Lie demystifies an essential new literacy, one that will make us better equipped to navigate our data-driven world.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

Depending on how many people join, we might have to turn off webcams at some point. But we'd love to see your faces, so rather not :) Don't worry about pets and family members in frame, we'd love to see them too. Just make sure everyone is wearing pants (the family members, not the pets).<br/>Also - we've heard some rumors of Zoom meetings being spammed with people screen sharing with unwanted information, so we will try to avoid that.<\/p> ",

W ramach prezentacji pokażę, na czym polega modelowanie epidemii i jakie podejścia mogą być tutaj zastosowane. Zaprezentuję podstawowe modele epidemiologiczne oparte o równania różniczkowe oraz ich rozszerzenia. Ponadto przedstawię jak dopasować modele do bieżących danych, korzystając z technik uczenia bayesowskiego. Na koniec pokaże jak z wykorzystaniem tych modeli można prognozować różne scenariusze przebiegu pandemii w zależności od podjętych działań, mających na celu hamowanie jej rozwoju.<\/p> <p>Adam Gonczarek jest współzałożycielem i szefem technologii w Alphamoon, polskiej firmie świadczącej usługi z zakresu sztucznej inteligencji i uczenia maszynowego. Posiada doktorat z informatyki z Politechniki Wrocławskiej, gdzie pracował również jako adiunkt do 2019. Swoje doświadczenie zdobył pracując jako wykonawca, konsultant i lider zespołów AI w projektach B+R i projektach komercyjnych, zarówno dla dużych firm, jak i startupów.<\/p> <p>Sponsorem spotkań i fundacji WhyR? jest firma Kruk S.A.<\/p> ",

City Creek has free two hour parking or you can take the Trax blue or green line to the City Center station.<\/p> <p>The most commonly taught types of regression are linear (where the dependent variable can be any real number) and logistic (where the dependent variable is binary). However, many types of data don't fall into either of these two categories. In this session, we will review regression techniques that can handle other kinds of inputs: censored normal, logit-normal, and beta regression (for dependent variables that are bounded above and/or below); ordered logistic regression (for multiple discrete outcomes that are logically ordered, such as Likert ratings); and multinomial logistic regression (for discrete outcomes that aren't ordered). These techniques provide a better representation of the processes they are modeling and allow us to make more realistic predictions.<\/p> <p>Abby Kaplan is a data scientist at Salt Lake Community College.

Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>COVID-19 is the latest, and most impactful, of new infectious diseases emerging with increasing frequency in the 21st century. Novel contacts between humans and wildlife, and dense and increasingly mobile human populations all drive risk of pandemics like the one we are living through. I will discuss the data science and analytical challenges in identifying and predicting new emerging diseases and tracking, predicting, and managing COVID-19. I will discuss the R tools used by virus hunters and epidemiologists in addressing these challenges, and lessons that apply to other fields. Finally, I'll discuss ways R users and data scientists can contribute to supporting public health and preventing the next pandemic.<\/p> <p>About Noam:<br/>Noam Ross is Principal Scientist for Computational Science at EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit in NYC that researches the connections between human and wildlife health. Noam builds models to understand and predict disease circulation in wildlife, spillover into people, and spread through travel and trade.

Dr. Masood describes one of Magenta's use cases built to reduce customer churn. He will explain the neural network model developed along with the baysian optimization that runs on top to find the best hyper-parameters. Additionally, the concept of shaply values is explained which was used to identify the reasons for churn.<br/>After finishing his PhD in information technology, Dr. Masood joined Magenta Telekom as a data scientist in 2017 and now heads the team as lead data scientist. His interests includes deep neural networks, ensemble trees and baysian optimization techniques. During his employment, he has worked on several use cases including network quality estimation, customer churn and retention, house hold matching, customer lifetime value, propensity modelling for x/up-selling, price to demand analysis, portfolio optimization and many more.<\/p> <p>2. Data Anomalies are a hot topic for many clients spread over all industries. Detecting them is a hot topic for data scientists. As it often comes to the question “What are we actually looking for?”, a first step is towards unsupervised learning.<br/>With mathematical methods like Robust Principle Component Analysis we managed to distinguish anomalies from “usual” data points. Furthermore the detection tool was integrated in a webservice also built with R packages and was lifted into production.<br/>Felix is working for Accenture since 2018 as a Data Scientist. During his mathematics studies he specialized on forecasting, time series analysis and statistics, which also increased his R-Developer Skills. Knowledge in this topics made Felix participating in several machine learning projects at Accenture in public sector as well as financial sector. R as coding language was a central skill in many of those projects.<\/p> <p>Stay at Home and Healthy!<\/p> <p>Greetings,<br/>ViennaR organizers<\/p> ",

In this talk, I’ll cover my experiences with data community building and share strategies from open source communities such as R-Ladies and The Carpentries, as well as the spatial data science community I support at my research center. I’ll discuss the value of the data community builder and their role within / outside of institutions for encouraging uptake of technical tools. Some of the skills needed for these roles may not be what you think: building relationships, being empathetic toward use cases (and users!), organizing events, teaching effectively, and setting strategy for expanding data networks, among others.<\/p> <p>Learner-centered teaching for the non-traditional data science classroom<br/>Katherine Simeon (with Diya Das &amp; Angela Li)<\/p> <p>There is considerable variability in how individuals learn computing skills. While many formal courses, both online and in-person, are available to learners, typical methods of learning are acquiring knowledge on-the-job and participating in short-term workshops. While these non-traditional contexts are highly successful, instructors are challenged to capitalize on a limited amount of time and resources, while catering to learners of different backgrounds and experience levels. In this talk, we will discuss how pedagogic research can be applied to computing &amp; programming education in non-traditional settings (e.g., corporate training, 1-day workshops, and one-on-one mentorship). Specifically, we will explore how to modify established learning formats in order to address specific needs of learners. Finally, we will outline best practices to facilitate a collaborative and inclusive learning environment that can motivate both instructors and learners.<\/p> <p>--------- Schedule ---------<\/p> <p>6:00 - 6:10 -- Announcements &amp; Intros<br/>6:10 - 6:30 -- Angela's Talk on Data Science Communities<br/>6:35 - 6:55 -- Katherine's Talk on Learner-Centered Teaching<\/p> <p>---------------------------------<\/p> <p>Q: Are men welcome to attend this event?<br/>A: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor.

This introduction to geospatial data uses location data collected from flatfish and rockfish in southern California to demonstrate how to use RStudio for basic mapping projects. We will discuss the basics of geospatial data, including what shapefiles are and how to read and display them properly in RStudio, as well as how to use RStudio to answer more advanced questions, such as, “What kind of environments are these fish exposed to?” and “Are these fish using areas close to underwater structures, like artificial reefs?” In general, geospatial data can be used to answer a wider variety of questions and RStudio is particularly useful for displaying trends in these data that may be undetectable by simply looking at values within rows and columns. Let’s get mapping!<\/p> <p># Live-streaming &amp; Meeting Materials<br/>- All registered attendees will receive a Zoom link to join the meeting.

As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two lenses of knowledge together to take us on “a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical, as clever as it is wise” (Elizabeth Gilbert).<\/p> <p>Drawing on her life as an indigenous scientist, and as a woman, Kimmerer shows how other living beings—asters and goldenrod, strawberries and squash, salamanders, algae, and sweetgrass—offer us gifts and lessons, even if we've forgotten how to hear their voices. In reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members' R skills &amp; knowledge through social, collaborative learning &amp; sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills &amp; careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!<\/p> <p>A local chapter of R-Ladies Global, R-Ladies Dallas exists to promote gender diversity in the R community worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.<\/p> <p>Q: Are men welcome to attend R-Ladies events?<br/>A: Yes, men are welcome at this event. Our mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. Please help us by spreading the word about R-Ladies, and by being respectful of the fact that this event is primarily for women/non-binary/female-identifying individuals.<\/p> <p>We expect all attendees to abide &amp; be governed by our community code of conduct. Please take a moment to review our R-Ladies Global code of conduct (particularly if this is your first time attending!): <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct<\/a>.<\/p> ",
