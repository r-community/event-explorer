This type of work often involves trade processing, trade confirmation, and settlement of payments. In many institutions, much of this work is done manually using excel spreadsheets. This presentation will focus on how someone in the back-office can use R to automate manual processes and how they might convince others on their team to join the journey.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Mandip Mistry is a Business Analyst at the Health Care of Ontario Pension Plan. In his role, he is responsible for enhancements and ongoing support of HOOPP's internal stress testing system which provides risk reporting to a variety of stakeholders within the organization. Before this, he spent 5 years in Investment Operations (aka back-office) helping automate manual excel processes while developing a healthy obsession for all things R. Mandip is also a certified tidyverse instructor currently working with back and middle office staff who have fallen out of love with Excel.<\/p> <p>This is a cross-post from the group here: <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/RStudio-Enterprise-Community-Meetup\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/RStudio-Enterprise-Community-Meetup<\/a><\/p> <p>You can RSVP here on the Boston group though and don't have to join the group above, well unless you want to :)<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Abstract:<br/>Have you ever found yourself trying to make a plot look prettier?<br/>When looking for color palette inspiration, Josiah often turns to the Instagram page @colorpalette.cinema for inspiration. Color Palette Cinema is an awesome page that takes stills from films and creates a nice palette of 10 colors from the image. These can range from bright hues, to monochromatic masterpieces. To make use of these colors, Josiah created a ¾ baked package {cpcinema}. When sharing an image from using this package on Twitter, it hadn’t crossed his mind that many others may want to use this as well. Josiah will cover the package itself - what it is and what it does, and why he didn’t initially release it but probably should. He will also include a few lessons learned and recommendations as you think about putting your own packages out into the world as well.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Josiah Parry is a self-avowed social data scientist - in that his existence in academe was focused on the social sciences and his professional “career” has been focused on data science. Josiah a graduate of Plymouth State University class of 2018 with a degree in Sociology and Anthropology, a minor in Mathematics, and a certificate in geographic information systems (GIS). April 2020, he earned his MS in Urban Informatics from Northeastern University under Daniel T. O’Brien. The culmination of my MS is the “Urban Informatics Toolkit”, a free online text intended to introduce new students of the field to R. Josiah works on the customer success team at RStudio with public sector customers.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Speaker: Dr. Krisztian Magori<\/p> <p>Title: Using R to analyze and model COVID-19 cases<\/p> <p>Abstract: Many years from now, we will all think back to what we were doing during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how we contributed to resolving it. In my presentation, I will show you three small projects I conducted related to the pandemic, and look for your feedback. First, I analyzed COVID-19 case trends across the State of Washington, particularly in Spokane, in order for myself to see behind daily case counts, and still looking for ways to expand that. Second, I tested the oft-heard suggestion that increased case numbers in the fall of 2020 were simply due to increased testing, using bootstrapping methods. Finally, I developed a stochastic, spatially explicit model to simulate COVID-19 transmission within a facility, such as a dorm, with visualization conducted in R.<\/p> <p>Speaker Profile: Krisztian Magori,Ph.D., is a Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Department of Biology at Eastern Washington University. He teaches biostatistics using R at both the undergraduate and graduate level, and consults with faculty and students on statistical analysis of their datasets. In addition, he is a disease ecologist, focusing on ticks and mosquitoes, when we don't have a pandemic that's more important.<\/p> ",

Such a graphical representation is convenient, since, for high-dimensional problems the local interpretation of a subset of variables can be interpreted in the sub-graph induced by these variables and variables connected to these. By exploiting the graph-theoretic representation, general algorithms can be used for computing marginal and conditional probabilities. For problems large enough, it can be impossible to compute such probabilities without exploiting the graphical representation. Of particular importance for calculations of probabilities in graphical models is the Junction Tree Algorithm (JTA).<\/p> ",

My co-authors and I modeled the results of such an MCED test based on published literature when applied to a population of screenable individuals. The model found a potential to intercept 2 in 5 cancer cases, including many cancers generally found only at late stage with current medical practice.

His background spans from biotechnology to bioinformatics and biostatistics. His research focuses on prostate and breast tumour microenvironment, the development of statistical model for the analysis of RNA sequencing data, and data analysis and visualisation interfaces.<\/p> <p>▶️ About Dr. Maria Doyle:<br/>Dr. Maria Doyle is the Application and Training Specialist for Research Computing at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, Australia. She has a PhD in Molecular Biology and currently works in bioinformatics and data science education and training. She is passionate about supporting researchers, reproducible research, open source and tidy data.<\/p> <p>▶️ About the workshop:<\/p> <p>This workshop will present how to perform analysis of RNA sequencing data following the tidy data paradigm (Wickham and others 2014). The tidy data paradigm provides a standard way to organise data values within a dataset, where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and data is manipulated using an easy-to-understand vocabulary. Most importantly, the data structure remains consistent across manipulation and analysis functions.<br/>This can be achieved for RNA sequencing data with the tidybulk, tidyHeatmap (Mangiola and Papenfuss 2020) and tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) packages. The tidybulk package provides a tidy data structure and a modular framework for bulk transcriptional analyses. tidyHeatmap provides a tidy implementation of ComplexHeatmap. These packages are part of the tidytranscriptomics suite that introduces a tidy approach to RNA sequencing data representation and analysis. The last section of the workshop will be focused on the analysis of single cell data in a tidy fashion with the packages tidySCE and tidyseurat.<\/p> <p>The topics presented in this workshop will be:<\/p> <p>▪️ Data exploration<br/>▪️ Data dimensionality reduction and clustering<br/>▪️ Differential gene expression analysis<br/>▪️ Data visualisation<\/p> <p>In order to attend the event, please fill out this form 👉 <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y88sxkos\" class=\"linkified\">https://tinyurl.com/y88sxkos<\/a><\/p> <p>We will send you the Zoom link and the enter passcode a few hours before the training session.

    "start": "2021-04-21",
    "description": "<p>We're happy to have a wonderful speaker and topic to start our first virtual meetup. Abed W Ayyad (<a href=\"https://manipulativegerbil.blogspot.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://manipulativegerbil.blogspot.com/<\/a>) will share his exploration of solar PV and how R can be used for solar PV in Alberta.<\/p> <p>Solar energy converted to electricity (photovoltaic, or PV, electricity) seems almost too good to be true when it comes to thinking about ways of reducing global carbon emissions. According to a widely repeated claim, one hour's worth of the solar radiation which falls on the earth's surface could meet human energy needs for one year. Though impressive and technically \"correct\", this is far from being a practical or meaningful calculation. So how much carbon-neutral electricity could someone sitting in the Canadian prairies actually harvest from the sunshine falling on their backyard?<\/p> <p>R lends itself perfectly to the data intensive task of planning and predicting the amount of solar insolation which falls on a given location, and the electricity which one can expect to harvest from it. Following a (very) broad introduction to solar energy and photovoltaics, we will explore a number of packages available in R which make it possible to access and analyse publicly available data on solar insolation, and to understand what this might mean in terms of solar PV potential at a site in Alberta. We will accomplish the latter by doing a walk-through of an example using the nasapower package available in CRAN, as well as a number of the graphics and GIS-related packages also available in R. This talk, aimed at a wide audience of R users, will illustrate why Alberta is a surprisingly perfect location for solar PV deployment and how you can convince yourself of that using R.<\/p> <p>About the speaker: Abed has used R in a variety of settings for seven years now, for GIS/cartography applications, data analysis and linear optimisation. There are many reasons to love R, but the community of users is definitely one of the biggest. Last September, Edmonton became the 10th city which Abed has called home during his life. Abed is looking forward to discovering more of the city, and to cycling to some parks and lakes as the summer goes on and the days get longer.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>We have our second Rust talk in three months, this time about integrating R and Rust.<\/p> <p>Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Conversations during the meetup are encouraged in the monthly-meetup-chat channel in the nyhackr slack.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Rust is a relatively new programming language that is rapidly gaining in popularity. It is designed to be suitable for low-level system programming with high performance and low overhead while providing modern abstractions and protection from undefined behavior. The most common application scenarios for Rust are those that otherwise might be suitable for C or C++. As such, Rust may be a good choice for writing extensions to high-level interactive languages such as R. The extendr project was founded with the goal to make writing Rust extensions to R as easy and painless as possible. At the same time, extendr also enables the reverse use case, writing standalone Rust programs that call R code and take advantage of the R runtime. This talk will provide an overview of the extendr API and its key design choices, and it will highlight simple use cases and known pitfalls. The talk is meant primarily as an introduction to Rust for current R users. However, experienced Rust programmers who want to branch out into data science and statistical programming may also find this talk helpful.<\/p> <p>About Claus:<br/>Claus Wilke is the Jane and Roland Blumberg Centennial Professor in Molecular Evolution at The University of Texas at Austin. He holds a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Bochum in Germany, and he received postdoctoral training in biological physics in the lab of Chris Adami at Caltech. Claus Wilke has published extensively in the areas of computational biology, evolutionary biology, protein biochemistry, and virology. He has also authored several popular R packages used for data visualization, such as cowplot, ggridges, and ggtext, and he is a regular contributor to the package ggplot2.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EDT and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

This holds especially true once you've found a workaround for doing something particular because you're little likely to search for more efficient ways of handling that matter. In our experience, the best way to learn the little things that make an impact is through other useRs.<\/p> <p>For our April meetup, we would like to draw from the experiences of other useRs' and ask each of the participants to show their favorite thing about R or RStudio. Whether it's an underused feature, a package, a function or a shortcut you discovered - let us know! If it is a brand new feature of the latest version of R or RStudio – we're happy to hear about it!<\/p> <p>There is no need to prepare a fancy presentation on something highly sophisticated. Just take a minute and think about the things that you really like and want others to know about. As always, R users of all levels of expertise are welcome.

    "description": "<p>Hello R-Ladies!<\/p> <p>Join us on April 28th for a workshop on Tidyverse functions!<\/p> <p>Event Description: Tidyverse functions were designed for their ease of use by humans, and are best known and used in interactive R coding, or as part of a literate code document (e.g., R Markdown) or script, where they are run in the global environment (i.e., not inside a function). Here they feel easy to use and powerful, as you can access things like column names as if they were available to you as objects themselves. However, this ease of use by humans is a trade off for “more work required” when you want to start programming with these. For example, when using them inside functions. In this short workshop, we will introduce what makes programming with Tidyverse functions challenging and how we can rise up to meet these challenges.<\/p> <p>**This workshop assumes you have used 2-3 Tidyverse functions and know how to write a function in R. (See below for resources) ***<\/p> <p>About the Speaker: Dr. Tiffany Timbers is an Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Statistics and a Co-Director for the Master of Data Science program (Vancouver Option) at the University of British Columbia. In these roles, she teaches and develops curriculum around the responsible application of Data Science to solve real-world problems. One of her favourite courses she teaches is a graduate course on collaborative software development, which focuses on teaching how to create R and Python packages using modern tools and workflows.<\/p> <p>Workshop details:<br/>Date and time: April 28th, 2021 at 6:00pm<br/>Webinar link: RSVP to view link<br/>Note: Meeting password is embedded in the link after ?pwd<br/>If you have trouble getting into the meeting, please message Jasmine<\/p> <p>***<br/>General workshop information:<\/p> <p>-Please expect a hands-on session in a friendly and laid-back atmosphere where we all encouraged to learn together.<br/>- This workshop assumes you have used 2-3 Tidyverse functions and know how to write a function in R.

You can come to University of Sydney in person (location: F10A[masked].Law Annex Lecture Theatre 024). Or join via zoom.<\/p> <p>Data sometimes have artefacts which obscure the patterns we are interested in visualising. You may have come across this when trying to interpret a residual plot from a logistic regression. For discrete data, these are not really artefacts, they are properties of the distribution of the data, like mean-variance relationships and lots of zeros. Generalised linear models and their extensions model the distribution of the data, including these properties, and so are a good way to remove them, to better see the patterns we are actually interested in. I will talk though some concepts and lots of examples of how we can use models to get the best out of our visualisations of discrete multivariate data in R.<\/p> <p>Biography<br/>Gordana is a statistical consultant and research fellow at UNSW Sydney, with research interests in modelling and visualising multivariate discrete data in ecology.

It has a built-in shiny app and saves results to a disk. It was written to show sambas to our English and Spanish-speaking friends, and a way to practice package writing and shiny, and to learn about APIs.<\/p> <p>🎉Stephanie Hickey on BRRR (by Brooke Watson Madubuonwu)<\/p> <p>“Have you ever wanted to know - and celebrate - when your scripts are finally done running in R? Have you ever been so proud of pulling off a tricky bit of code that you wanted Flavor Flav to yell \"yeaaahhhh, boi!!\" as soon as it successfully completes? Have you ever gotten an error message that felt like DJ Khaled yelling, \"They don't wanna see us win!\" Probably not, but you might now. And with BRRR, you can.”<\/p> <p>🗺️Kayla Johnson on personalized map art<\/p> <p>Map art makes beautiful posters.

    "description": "<p>This Spring, Cal Poly's Data Science Initiative is running a series of python-based Data Science workshops for faculty professional development.<\/p> <p>We are able to open a limited number of spots to the general public. This workshop is remote; a Zoom link will become visible upon RSVP and further details will be emailed.<\/p> <p>Please see the description below for this second workshop, Introduction to Programming in Python<\/p> <p>There is no fee for this workshop; however, we are asking that you make a donation to the Cal Poly Black Student Scholarship Fund (<a href=\"https://www.calfund.org/calpolyblackstudentfund/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.calfund.org/calpolyblackstudentfund/<\/a>) in lieu of a workshop fee. The suggested donation is $50.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>Programming in Python is a six-hour workshop (across two days) that will introduce basic python syntax, data structures, and a few widely used python libraries.<\/p> <p>The workshop will focus on developing practical programming skills that are immediately applicable to data analysis and visualization. Topics covered include introductory python syntax (assigning variables, lists, slicing, conditionals, for loops, etc.), file parsing, analyzing tabular data using numpy, plotting data using matplotlib, and accessing data in pandas.<\/p> <p>The workshop is six-hours long, split over two days; it is important that participants attend both days.<\/p> <p>No prior programming experience is required.<\/p> <p>At the end of the workshop, self-paced curricular materials will be provided that cover more advanced topics like writing functions, curve fitting, testing with pytest, and more advanced data visualization techniques.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>Preparation steps for attendees:<\/p> <p>The workshop will be taught in a “live-coding” style where code is demonstrated live and you follow along, followed by examples and exercises to solidify your understanding. Note that since the you will want to be typing in your own jupyter notebook while watching the workshop, it is very helpful to have two screens so that you can watch the zoom meeting in one window and type in another window.<\/p> <p>While there are ways to access a programming environment online, I strongly recommend that you install python and set up a development environment on your own computer, so you can continue working in python after the workshop is over. These are the things you need to do to set up your computer to get ready for the workshop.<\/p> <p>1. Install anaconda. (<a href=\"https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Anaconda is a python package manager. This means it is software that helps you install python and other python packages (we’ll talk more about what python packages are in the workshop). Go to the link above and download the appropriate package for your operating system. In virtually all cases, you want the 64-bit version and not the 32-bit. The default options are generally fine. If you are a windows user, be sure you choose Make anaconda the default python in the setup.<\/p> <p>2. Download the workshop files. (<a href=\"https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/data/data.zip\" class=\"linkified\">https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/data/data.zip<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Download the zip file linked above. Create a folder on your Desktop called python-workshop (use a dash or underscore in the name; do NOT use a space), move the zip file to your python-workshop folder, and unzip the file.<\/p> <p>3. Test your setup. From Finder or Spotlight (Mac OS) or the Start Menu (Windows) find the Anaconda Navigator. The icon looks like a green circle. Click Launch under Jupyter Notebook. It may take a few seconds to load the page, especially if it is the first time you have ever used the jupyter notebook, so don’t panic if nothing loads for a few seconds. Then a new window should open in your default internet browser. Use the file navigation window to navigate to Desktop and then to the python-workshop folder. In the upper right hand corner, click New, then choose Python 3 from the dropdown list. This should start a new jupyter notebook in python 3 and you are ready to go!<\/p> ",

The nyccensus package is a simple data-sharing package meant to ease the pains of accessing and wrangling publicly-available response rate data from the 2020 Decennial Census as well as other relevant demographic data from the American Community Survey at various geographic levels in New York City. I will share some lessons learned and examples of how these data can be used to better understand and address equity issues in NYC.<\/p> <p>Bio: Natalie O'Shea is a researcher and data visualization specialist with a passion for equity, accessibility, and human-centered design. She started her data science journey during graduate school, falling in love with all things R in her coursework and research. She was part of CUNY's first Data for Public Good cohort before taking a position as a Community Outreach Data Analyst with the NYC Census 2020 initiative and then working as a Data Visualization Specialist at NYC Test &amp; Trace Corps. She is currently working as a Data Visualization Analyst on the Research and Learning Engineering team at Edmentum.<\/p> <p>\"Creating Production Level Data Science Code\"<br/>Speaker: Megan Robertson<\/p> <p>Abstract: Writing code is a big part of working as a data scientist. You write code throughout all stages of a project from exploratory data analysis to building models. This talk focuses on creating production code from a proof of concept analysis or model. How do you organize and adapt all the code created to get to a proof of concept? Do you feel overwhelmed by everything you need to do? At the end of this talk you’ll walk away with tips and strategies to make your own production code.<\/p> <p>Bio: Megan Robertson is a Senior Data Scientist at Nike. She has multiple years of experience applying data science in retail settings. She first became interested in math and statistics through sports analytics, and wrote her Master’s thesis in collaboration with an NBA team. Her background includes training in Bayesian methodology, statistical modeling, machine learning and more. Megan has delivered multiple talks on various aspects of data science from building a career and project management to writing code. She is currently writing her first data science book, Mastering Communication in Data Science, in partnership with Manning.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Would you like to get together with a few friends and learn together? I have been starting to learn R and Python for data science and following the typical route of videos and practice projects. I really want to ramp up my learning and exposure to different ways.

NLP models are great at processing digital text, but many real-word applications use documents with more complex formats. For example, healthcare systems often include visual lab results, sequencing reports, clinical trial forms, and other scanned documents. When we only use an NLP approach for document understanding, we lose layout and style information - which can be vital for document image understanding. New advances in multi-modal learning allow models to learn from both the text in documents (via NLP) and visual layout (via computer vision).<\/p> <p>We provide multi-modal visual document understanding, built on Spark OCR based on the LayoutLM architecture. It achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy in several downstream tasks, including form understanding (from 70.7 to 79.3), receipt understanding (from 94.0 to 95.2) and document image classification (from 93.1 to 94.4).<\/p> <p>Register Here: <a href=\"https://events.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-document-understanding-with-multi-modal-image-text-mining-in-spark-ocr-3\" class=\"linkified\">https://events.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-document-understanding-with-multi-modal-image-text-mining-in-spark-ocr-3<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>When we make an inventory of opportunities to add value to organizations with data, often there is low hanging fruit that does not require much investment in actual data analysis, but can be solved by automating data aspects of business processes. In fact there is a whole industry around this called robotic process automation (RPA). But where RPA offers a low-code approach to setting up automation tasks, it is easy to undervalue R for setting up these tasks with R code.<\/p> <p>In this talk I would like to share some of the experiences we have had automating tasks with R. The tools we use range from great packages like fs to work with the filesystem on the R side. But there are also packages to make it easier to work with cron jobs on Linux (cronR) and the task scheduler on Windows (taskscheduleR).<\/p> <p>When you combine this with other tools of the automation trade like httr to access API's or plumber to write API's there is practically no limit to what you can achieve using only R and readily available tools on linux and windows. I hope that the talk will inspire a lively discussion where we share experiences and ideas about automating processes with R.<\/p> <p>Frans van Dunné (<a href=\"https://www.fransvandunne.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.fransvandunne.com/<\/a>) is Chief Data Officer at ixpantia (<a href=\"https://www.ixpantia.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ixpantia.com/<\/a>).

Frans has a PhD in biology from the University of Amsterdam and has taught at universities in Europe and Latin America. As a consultant he has worked with companies around the world on diverse topics, including data driven innovation, applied statistics, statistical programming and machine learning.<\/p> <p>Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Our June Meetup will be a remote gathering; the Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Infographics are everywhere, and when well-designed can be a fantastic way of sharing data highlights in an engaging and visually appealing way to non-technical audiences. Typically infographics are custom made by a graphic designer who has been provided the numbers that will be represented in the graphic, and therefore can be time-intensive to produce. Producing more than one infographic of the same design to display different values (for instance, for different geographical areas) has a linear increase in production time for each n+1 graphic once the basic design time has been accounted for. This talk will describe a novel method for producing infographics using R that allows for dynamically adjusting the graphical elements based on any number of data values and rapidly producing bespoke versions. A walkthrough of the process used to create 3,142 custom infographics (one for each county in the US) will be presented to illustrate the process.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Zadra, PhD is a Director of Data Science at the non-profit Sorenson Impact Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The substantial uncertainty means that point estimates are much less informative than confidence intervals.

    "description": "<p>Productivity in R often boils down to automating repetitive steps, and iterating over a structured dataset is a common task in more complex data manipulation.<\/p> <p>There are many ways to achieve this: While some feel most comfortable writing procedural for-loops, others Vectorize() their functions in order to pass them multiple values at once. Yet another camp swears by the functional style of purrr's map() and reduce() functions (the tidy alternative to the the *apply family of functions in base R). And a fourth category of useRs struggle to get their head wrapped around serializiation in the first place. (Let's just ignore the hopeless cases who write straight-up recursive functions with no concern for stack size.)<\/p> <p>It has been rumored that a more functional style makes everything faster – but is that really true? Doesn't it make the code just too hard to read? And can any loop really be replaced by a map?<\/p> <p>For our May meeting, let's challenge the functional fanboys and *girls among us. Bring a contained, reproducible example loop (side effects welcome!) and we will ask the mapheads to reformulate it as a higher order function.<\/p> <p>As always, useRs of all backgrounds and at all levels of expertise are invited to participate. Learning R is not a competition. Come join us!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>*What are we going to learn:<br/>Do you use statistical models in R or want to learn? Learn how to best structure your model workflows including reading in data, checking the data, performing analyses, and plotting. The presentation will also go into more advanced topics discussing the R-INLA package for modelling spatio-temporal data. R-INLA is a powerful method that uses integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to create complex models with various types of random effects such as spatial and temporal autocorrelation and run them very fast (<a href=\"https://www.r-inla.org/home\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.r-inla.org/home<\/a>). In this talk, we will specially focus on how to model spatial autocorrelation using coral recovery data. Best for those who are comfortable with R but all are welcome.<\/p> <p>*Who is going to present:<br/>Dr. Julie Vercelloni is a quantitative ecologist that studied Marine Ecology during her undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and statistics applied to coral reef ecology for her PhD. She is now an Associate Investigator at the Queensland University of Technology node of the Australian Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers and works mostly with the Australian Institute of Marine Science.<br/>Julie is doing research on diverse projects that look at combining state-of-the-art technologies including machine learning and virtual reality, and modern statistical modelling methods to help understanding complex problems related to coral reef conservation. She is also a citizen science advocate, working on new types of monitoring for the Great Barrier Reef and Pacific countries.<\/p> <p>* When are we meeting?<br/>The talk will start at 5:30 pm for a ~45 minute presentation, 15 minutes Q&amp;A time with the potential to move to an outside venue for continued socializing and networking.<\/p> <p>* Where are we meeting?<br/>We will meet at QUT Gardens Point campus room Y-801 (in building Y) - this will be a hybrid event with a Zoom link available.<br/>map: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/4H51oEEun6JuewVn6\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/4H51oEEun6JuewVn6<\/a><\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there!<\/p> <p>R-Ladies Brisbane<\/p> <p>********************************************************************************<br/>Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: Photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community.

In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with. You will be able to create new columns and summary tables, subset interesting rows or columns, and combine and reshape dataframes. We will also dive into ggplot, one of the best tools for creating great-looking bar charts, scatterplots, and more!<\/p> <p>This is (currently) a five-part series, aimed at total beginners and/or people with some experience in base-R or tidyverse who are looking to freshen up or expand their skills.

They nourish other living organisms and supply psychological benefits to humans as well, improving our moods and beautifying the landscape around us. But plants don’t just passively provide. They also take action.<\/p> <p>Beronda L. Montgomery explores the vigorous, creative lives of organisms often treated as static and predictable. In fact, plants are masters of adaptation. They “know” what and who they are, and they use this knowledge to make a way in the world. Plants experience a kind of sensation that does not require eyes or ears. They distinguish kin, friend, and foe, and they are able to respond to ecological competition despite lacking the capacity of fight-or-flight. Plants are even capable of transformative behaviors that allow them to maximize their chances of survival in a dynamic and sometimes unfriendly environment.<\/p> <p>Lessons from Plants enters into the depth of botanic experience and shows how we might improve human society by better appreciating not just what plants give us but also how they achieve their own purposes. What would it mean to learn from these organisms, to become more aware of our environments and to adapt to our own worlds by calling on perception and awareness? Montgomery’s meditative study puts before us a question with the power to reframe the way we live: What would a plant do?<\/p> ",

The substantial uncertainty means that point estimates are much less informative than confidence intervals. I will describe a computationally intensive algorithm for producing a 95% confidence interval for tephra fall volume, using a variety of modern statistical tools. I will also describe the various R packages and tools that I use.<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Jonty Rougier is a consulting statistician, formerly Professor of Statistical Science and Head of Statistics in the School of Mathematics, University of Bristol (up to June 2019).

Brooke will discuss \"Flexible reproducibility in data workflows\".<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Flexible reproducibility in data workflows<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: Sometimes, when data collected for an analysis doesn’t change, the process of tidying is a one-time investment. Other times, raw data changes by the hour or minute, requiring automated systems of extraction, transformation, and loading. But what of the case in the middle? How should analysts and data scientists handle the system changes, the month-over-month tweaks, and data sources that involve a human in the loop?<\/p> <p>This talk will cover strategies and tactics for creating resilient and flexible reproducibility in data workflows. I’ll discuss real-world examples, explore mistakes I've made along the way, and share R packages and functions that help navigate the space between customization and automation.<\/p> <p>Bio: Brooke Madubuonwu is the Director of Legal Analytics &amp; Quantitative Research at the American Civil Liberties Union, where she &amp; her team use data science &amp; statistics to advance civil rights through advocacy, legislative support, and litigation. Her work ranges from the measurement of racial and gender disparities in housing, education, and criminal justice, to the analysis of gerrymandered voting districts throughout the US. Before joining the ACLU, she trained as an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and studied zoonotic viruses as a research scientist at the NY-based nonprofit, EcoHealth Alliance.
