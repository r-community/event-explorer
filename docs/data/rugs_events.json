While this reputation is not deserved, nevertheless we sometimes write code that runs slowly for one reason or another. The process of profiling allows us to identify speed bottlenecks in our functions, while benchmarking allows us to compare the speed of alternative approaches. Let’s dig into R’s profiling and benchmarking tools and learn some tips for speeding up our code.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: Adam Austin<br/>Adam Austin received his M.S. in Biostatistics from the University of California, Davis in 2014. Now living in the Chicago area, he works as a data scientist and manager at Allstate Insurance where he builds predictive models, coordinates the Allstate R User Group, writes R packages to improve the quality of life, and trolls the Python message boards. His spare time is largely consumed by wrangling three children, but he also enjoys bicycling, hunting, indoor rock climbing, and hipster coffee. He misses California daily.<\/p> <p>**Talk2** (25min talk, 5min Q&amp;A)<\/p> <p>Title: Non-exhaustive list of lesser used base R features<br/>Abstract: Demonstration of several lesser known R features, including special subsetting rules, infix replacement functions, and the logic behind the base plotting paradigm. Each feature will be explored by constructing a few toy examples as well as presenting their possible use cases in the real world.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: Karolis Koncevičius<br/>Karolis Koncevičius works as a researcher at the institute of Biotechnology in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he uses R to analyse large genomic datasets. He also teaches a course about biomedical data analysis at the Vilnius University and has authored and co-authored a few R packages: 'matrixTests', 'annmatrix', 'basetheme', 'inops', 'DiscoRhythm'.<\/p> <p>**Code of Conduct**: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>**Schedule**<br/>6:40 open zoom<br/>6:50-7:30 Talk1<br/>7:30-8:00 Talk2<br/>~8:30 Virtual Social<\/p> <p>**LA R Users Group**<br/>Invite yourself to our Slack group: <a href=\"https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/<\/a><br/>Ask us any questions by email: [masked]<br/>Find our previous talks on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/presentations\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/presentations<\/a><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @la_Rusers<br/>Check out more events: <a href=\"https://laocr.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://laocr.org/<\/a><\/p> <p>***** DON'T BE SHY *******<br/>Reach out if you want to be our speaker.

The initial problem was to estimate inequality indexes (e.g., the Gini coefficient) from ACS income data (<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/data/datasets.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/data/datasets.html<\/a>), which is binned. Their work eventually appeared in Sociological Science (open access link: <a href=\"https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v4-26-641/\" class=\"linkified\">https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v4-26-641/<\/a>). Lessons to R users include the relative ease of contributing to CRAN, and the benefits (and pitfalls) therein.<\/p> <p>More about our presenter:<br/>Dave Hunter has been teaching mathematics and computer science at Westmont College since 2000. In the 90's he spent some time teaching high school in the suburbs of Chicago, after which he completed his Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Virginia, specializing in algebraic topology. His publications include a book, Essentials of Discrete Mathematics, and numerous journal articles such as How rare is symmetry in 12-tone musical rows?, Better Estimates from Binned Income Data: Interpolated CDFs and Mean-Matching, and New metrics for evaluating home plate umpire consistency and accuracy. He has co-directed Westmont in Mexico and enjoys running Santa Barbara’s trails, cheering for the Cubs, and cooking.<\/p> <p>PS: You need to RSVP to see the Zoom link<\/p> ",

These files are challenging to de-identify, because personal health information (PHI) can appear anywhere in free text – so cannot be removed with rules or regular expressions – or “burned” into images so that it’s not even available as digital text to begin with.<\/p> <p>This webinar presents a software system that tackles these challenges, with lessons learned from applying it in real-world production systems. The workflow uses:<\/p> <p>- Spark OCR to extract both digital and scanned text from PDF and DICOM files<br/>- Spark NLP for Healthcare to recognize sensitive data in the extracted free text<br/>- The de-identification module to delete, replace, or obfuscate PHI<br/>- Spark OCR to generate new PDF or DICOM file with the de-identified data<br/>- Run the whole workflow within a local secure environment, with no need to share data with any third party or a public cloud API<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0tjQ4Q0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0tjQ4Q0<\/a><\/p> ",

Quali strumenti o piattaforme di sviluppo diventeranno obsolete durante il prossimo anno?*<\/p> <p>Abbiamo deciso di supportare il nuovo questionario Developer Economics survey Q2 2020 per avere delle risposte.<br/>Il questionario è molto chiaro e diretto al sodo. Condividi le tue opinioni su i più popolari strumenti di sviluppo, piattaforme, tecnologie e framework. Cosa ti piace usare? Cosa hai provato ma poi subito abbandonato perché non abbastanza intuitivo, o cosa vorresti conoscere meglio?<\/p> <p>Rispondi a queste domande per aiutarci a scoprire cosa manca sul mercato. Il questionario è aperto solo a sviluppatori e data scientists, ma invita tutti a partecipare: studenti, professionisti, e coloro che si dilettano per hobby. I risultati saranno disponibili in autunno e pubblicati nel nuovo State of the Developer Nation (disponibile gratuitamente per tutti!). Qui avrai grafici e informazioni su trend globali che potrai utilizzare per avere un quadro più amplio e aggiornato del mercato.<\/p> <p>Coloro che si registrano e completano il questionario parteciperanno automaticamente all'estrazione di uno dei premi in palio. Il montepremi ammonta a +15 mila $, e sono inclusi premi tipo iPhone 11, Oculus Quest 64GB, JetBrains All Product Pack, Corsair Mechanical Gaming keyboard, Cloud Guru license, più una serie di gadgets e accessori, e vouchers Amazon. Sei pronto per una sfida? Ci sono altri 1000 $ in cash come premio se spargi la voce e altri sviluppatori partecipano al questionario.<\/p> <p>Un'altra cosa che è veramente importante è che per ogni questionario completato, doneremo $0.10 a Techfugees per supportare e aiutare gli sviluppatori di domani.<\/p> <p>Il questionario è aperto fino al 10 agosto, non perdere quest'occasione!<br/>I risultati del sondaggio sono ciò su cui si basa l'intero ecosistema per creare nuovi strumenti, piattaforme che saranno utilizzate in futuro da voi sviluppatori.<\/p> <p>Fallo per R-Ladies Bari. Se arriviamo ad un numero di risposte valide otterremo dei fondi da investire in un progetto congiunto tra RLadies Bari e RLadies Milano.<\/p> <p>Inizia qui 🚀<br/><a href=\"https://developereconomics.net?member_id=rladies_italy&amp;lang=en\" class=\"linkified\">https://developereconomics.net?member_id=rladies_italy&amp;lang=en<\/a><\/p> ",

The workshops cover machine learning in both R and Python, web scraping, shiny, GIS, git and the tidyverse. Speakers include Andrew Gelman, Emily Dodwell, Jon Krohn, Emily Robinson, Wes McKinney, Ludmila Janda, David Robinson and too many more to list here. Visit <a href=\"https://rstats.ai/nyr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstats.ai/nyr/<\/a> for more information and use code nyhackr for a 20% discount.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>When would you use an R notebook versus a project dependency graph solver? Should everything be an R package? What can your R project workflow optimise for, and which properties of your work can this affect?<\/p> <p>Despite the importance of questions like these to having a happy and productive time with R, there is little community consensus on the principles for establishing R project workflows.<\/p> <p>We will begin the session by examining these questions and mapping out workflow styles served by existing R tooling. In the second half I will demonstrate practical productivity boosters my team and I have implemented along the way to a workflow centered on {drake}.<\/p> <p>About Miles:<br/>I'm a Data Scientist at Queensland Fire and Emergency Services where I use R to identify and analyse investment options in our emergency services network. Since I started programming in R about 5 years ago I've become an active #rstats tweeter, blogger, and RWeekly editor. I was an organiser of a local meetup group, three rOpensci OzUnconferences, and useR! 2018 Brisbane. I release R packages that do extremely niche things. Everyone's favourite is {datapasta} but {fnmate} is probably the one I get the most personal joy out of. I am into workflows because of their capacity to change the way work feels.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>La realización de conferencias y meetups sobre R en modalidad virtual es una excelente oportunidad para que grupos menos representados en nuestra comunidad participen en estas instancias. Para muchas personas, la imposibilidad de viajar --sea por la razón que sea-- ha sido un impedimento para poder ser parte de estas actividades. Ahora tenemos una oportunidad que es importante que aprovochemos. Pero ¿cómo preparar una propuesta? ¿Qué debiese incluir el abstract? ¿Para qué conferencia es más apropiada la idea que tengo? ¿Qué debería tener en cuenta al pensar una propuesta de presentación para un meetup? ¿Es lo mismo escribir un abstract para una conferencia de R que para una conferencia en mi disciplina? ¿Qué tengo que incluir en la Bio? Para responder estas preguntas y compartir algunas recomendaciones para diseñar tu propuesta nos juntaremos el próximo sábado 1 de agosto :)<\/p> <p>- ¿Y si todavía no tengo una idea para una presentación?<\/p> <p>No importa. Durante la sesión hablaremos también sobre cómo generar ideas. Además, para el caso de algunas conferencias hay tiempo todavía. Quizás ahora mismo no se te ocurre nada en particular, pero puedes empezar a planear un proyecto para presentar en alguno de los eventos del próximo año.<\/p> <p>- ¿Qué necesito para participar?<\/p> <p>Lo primero, es leer nuestro código de conducta. Es requisito para asistir estar de acuerdo con él: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish<\/a>. Queremos que nuestros meetups sean un espacio seguro y amable en que todas las personas se sientan cómodas participando.<\/p> <p>Lo segundo, es asegurarte de que puedes utilizar la aplicación Zoom en tu computador. El día del taller te enviaremos el enlace para unirte (chequea ese día que el mensaje no se haya ido a la carpeta de spam). Usualmente compartimos el enlace 30 minutos antes de la sesión.<\/p> <p>- ¿Hay algo más que deba saber sobre este evento?<\/p> <p>Esta es una actividad organizada por los capítulos de RLadies de Chile en conjunto con LatinR (<a href=\"https://latin-r.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://latin-r.com/<\/a>), la Conferencia Latinoamericana sobre Uso de R en Investigación + Desarrollo.

Unlike many datasets that provide only aggregate case counts, the working group dataset collects individual-level case data, which are particularly valuable during outbreaks but are seldom made available in real time. This dataset feeds into an interactive dashboard, which enables users to visualize the data and identify key health outcome trends.<\/p> <p>The dataset and dashboard have become a reliable pan-Canadian source for COVID-19 information. Additionally, this has the potential for future linkages with diverse datasets, such as policy interventions, socio-behavioural changes, environmental factors, and other population-level factors. The open access aspect of this work encourages transparency and data sharing, which are crucial for supporting evidence-based control strategies and directing public health response efforts in Canada for the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p>This talk will provide an overview of the key features associated with the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group datasets and feature a demonstration of the tools available on the R Shiny dashboard. We will also discuss some of the key epidemiological insights that have been<br/>observed from this data and dashboard to date.<\/p> <p>About Isha Berry:<br/>Isha Berry is a PhD Candidate in Epidemiology at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health and a Fellow in the Emerging Leaders in Biosecurity Initiative at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security. She is a co-founder of the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group, which leads digital surveillance of COVID-19 cases in Canada to curate a publicly available line list and public-facing data dashboard. Isha has expertise in infectious disease epidemiology, geo-spatial methods, and mathematical modelling. Her primary area of research is understanding the socio-behavioral drivers of global emerging infectious diseases. She has experience conducting infectious disease research in low-, middle-, and high-income settings. She holds an MSc in Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a BSc in Environmental Science from McGill University.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>Please note that by attending you agree to abide by our code of conduct: <a href=\"https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/<\/a><\/p> <p>R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

    "description": "<p>The techniques in this tutorial enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of complicated projects with long runtimes. The drake R package resolves the dependency structure of data analysis pipelines, skips tasks that are already up to date, and cleanly organizes the output. Workflows with drake are efficient to maintain, and they provide tangible evidence that the results are synchronized with the underlying code and data, which increases one’s ability to trust the conclusions of the research.<\/p> <p>Learning objectives:<br/>1. Function-oriented programming: participants will learn to express data analysis tasks as user-defined<br/>functions, experience the advantages of functions relative to imperative scripts, and understand the role<br/>of functions in drake-powered projects.<br/>2. Declarative workflows: students will declare targets to represent data analysis artifacts, identify the<br/>dependencies of those targets, and inspect the emergent dependency structures of entire workflows.<br/>3. Project maintenance: students will experience drake’s responses to changing code and data, and they<br/>will understand the conditions that allow drake to skip computation and save time.<br/>4. Large plans: participants will practice declaring large collections of targets compactly using drake’s<br/>domain-specific language.<\/p> <p>Computing requirements:<br/>Each participant must have a laptop with a web browser and the ability to connect to the internet. Students will spend most of their time<br/>working through R notebooks and supporting Shiny applications.<br/>• notebooks: <a href=\"https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/tree/master/inst/notebooks\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/wlandau/learndrake/tree/master/inst/notebooks<\/a><br/>• learndrakeflow app: <a href=\"https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeflow\" class=\"linkified\">https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeflow<\/a><br/>• learndrakeplans app: <a href=\"https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeplans\" class=\"linkified\">https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/learndrakeplans<\/a><br/>• drakeplanner app: <a href=\"https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/drakeplanner\" class=\"linkified\">https://wlandau.shinyapps.io/drakeplanner<\/a><br/>Online RStudio Server instances will be provided so participants can interact with the notebooks without<br/>needing to install anything locally.<\/p> <p>The instructor:<br/>Will Landau received his PhD in Statistics at Iowa State University in 2016.

    "description": "<p>La realización de conferencias y meetups sobre R en modalidad virtual es una excelente oportunidad para que grupos menos representados en nuestra comunidad participen en estas instancias. Para muchas personas, la imposibilidad de viajar --sea por la razón que sea-- ha sido un impedimento para poder ser parte de estas actividades. Ahora tenemos una oportunidad que es importante que aprovochemos. Pero ¿cómo preparar una propuesta? ¿Qué debiese incluir el abstract? ¿Para qué conferencia es más apropiada la idea que tengo? ¿Qué debería tener en cuenta al pensar una propuesta de presentación para un meetup? ¿Es lo mismo escribir un abstract para una conferencia de R que para una conferencia en mi disciplina? ¿Qué tengo que incluir en la Bio? Para responder estas preguntas y compartir algunas recomendaciones para diseñar tu propuesta nos juntaremos el próximo sábado 1 de agosto :)<\/p> <p>- ¿Y si todavía no tengo una idea para una presentación?<\/p> <p>No importa. Durante la sesión hablaremos también sobre cómo generar ideas. Además, para el caso de algunas conferencias hay tiempo todavía. Quizás ahora mismo no se te ocurre nada en particular, pero puedes empezar a planear un proyecto para presentar en alguno de los eventos del próximo año.<\/p> <p>- ¿Qué necesito para participar?<\/p> <p>Lo primero, es leer nuestro código de conducta. Es requisito para asistir estar de acuerdo con él: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish<\/a>. Queremos que nuestros meetups sean un espacio seguro y amable en que todas las personas se sientan cómodas participando.<\/p> <p>Lo segundo, es asegurarte de que puedes utilizar la aplicación Zoom en tu computador. El día del taller te enviaremos el enlace para unirte (chequea ese día que el mensaje no se haya ido a la carpeta de spam). Usualmente compartimos el enlace 30 minutos antes de la sesión.<\/p> <p>- ¿Hay algo más que deba saber sobre este evento?<\/p> <p>Esta es una actividad organizada por los capítulos de RLadies de Chile en conjunto con LatinR (<a href=\"https://latin-r.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://latin-r.com/<\/a>), la Conferencia Latinoamericana sobre Uso de R en Investigación + Desarrollo.

On August 19th, 2020, we have a very exciting R Ladies presentation by Irene Steves and Yogev Herz, tuning in from Tel Aviv! (Yes, R-Ladies Amsterdam is globalizing =) !)<\/p> <p>[TOPIC]<br/>-----------<br/>Irene and Yogev work in Tel Aviv for the eCommerce fraud protection company Riskified.<\/p> <p>In their work, they often come across fraud patterns in eCommerce that their regular models cannot detect. While retraining models on newer data can solve some of these problems, some patterns require entirely new analyses.<\/p> <p>In this talk, Irene and Yogev will discuss how they tackled fraudsters taking advantage of \"Buy Online Pay in Store\" policies, and how R packages helped gradually transition from analyses to production-ready code.<\/p> <p>[ABOUT IRENE and YOGEV]<br/>-------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Irene holds an M.Sc. in Ecology and a B.A. in Integrative Biology, through which she first discovered R and data science. Her interest in data-led her to the Arctic Data Center at the University of California Santa Barbara, a summer internship at RStudio, and ultimately to the Research department at Riskified, where she now explores the fascinating patterns of fraud in e-commerce.<\/p> <p>Yogev first encountered R when studying the social organization of bumblebees for his M.Sc. in evolutionary biology. He transitioned to full-time R user and programmer when he left the hot and humid beehive to the air-conditioned office space of the research department in Riskified. He enjoys learning new R tricks and packages to improve the department’s data science capabilities.<\/p> <p>[PROGRAMME]<br/>---------------------<br/>18.30 - 18.35 Virtual Welcome<br/>18.35 - 18.45 Intro to R-Ladies and today's presentation<br/>18.45 - 19.20 Interactive presentation by Irene Steves and Yogev Herz<br/>19.15- 19.30 Questions and Discussion<\/p> <p>[ZOOM LINK]<br/>-------------------<br/>See on the right.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct.

    "description": "<p>Last month we hosted a tutorial as a part of useR!2020. We are running it again this month, for those who were unable to attend / did not get a ticket. The tutorial is valuable for everyone, but especially so for Masters and PhD students - if you know anyone who is busy with either of these, please encourage them to sign up on our group and RSVP :).<\/p> <p>Description:<br/>Have you ever struggled to re-run your own code or scripts you received from a collaborator? You’re not alone! Fortunately, there are simple practices that you can use to help you develop more reproducible R code. In this tutorial, you will 1) explore some of the common causes of non-reproducible code, 2) gain practical experience fixing reproducibility issues, and 3) use the R package workflowr (<a href=\"https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/<\/a>) to facilitate creation of more reproducible and shareable code. The tutorial will be hands-on and interactive, with small-group exercises.<\/p> <p>Prerequisites:<br/>Participants should have some experience using R (e.g. importing data from a file, loading a package). The tutorial will involve running R code in R Markdown files from the RStudio IDE. If you are unfamiliar with R Markdown, we recommend reviewing these short guides before participating in the tutorial: [Introduction](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html<\/a>), [How It Works](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html<\/a>), [Code Chunks](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html<\/a>].<\/p> <p>Requirements:<br/>A web browser, an account on GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/<\/a>), and an account on RStudio Cloud (<a href=\"https://rstudio.cloud/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.cloud/<\/a>). We will email you the tutorial materials, please also check your Spam / Junk Folder as materials often end up there when sent via Meetup.<\/p> <p>Instructors:<br/>Dr. Inger Fabris-Rotelli (and Vebash Naidoo) on behalf of Dr. John Blischak &amp; Dr. Peter Carbonetto.<\/p> <p>It will be an online meetup, and the link will be posted closer to the date.<\/p> ",

Luckily R has your back and teaching yourself new skills is something you can achieve from the comfort of your couch. In this talk I will walk you through the steps I took to analyse Metagenomic data using R and the accompanying publication-worthy graphs I learned to draw up as well as some basic statistics done on the metadata.<\/p> <p>I will also touch on three things that I found fundamental in the learning process:<br/>(1) Know the good R websites,<br/>(2) Phone a friend and<br/>(3) Don't be shy to re-do a lot of stuff.<\/p> <p>The purpose of this talk is to show that you can learn to do anything in R from scratch and produce really professional output and it won't cost you another PhD to do so!\"<\/p> <p>Join us online using the Google Meet link below - please mute when you join!<\/p> ",

    "start": "2020-08-01",
    "description": "<p>La realización de conferencias y meetups sobre R en modalidad virtual es una excelente oportunidad para que grupos menos representados en nuestra comunidad participen en estas instancias. Para muchas personas, la imposibilidad de viajar --sea por la razón que sea-- ha sido un impedimento para poder ser parte de estas actividades. Ahora tenemos una oportunidad que es importante que aprovochemos. Pero ¿cómo preparar una propuesta? ¿Qué debiese incluir el abstract? ¿Para qué conferencia es más apropiada la idea que tengo? ¿Qué debería tener en cuenta al pensar una propuesta de presentación para un meetup? ¿Es lo mismo escribir un abstract para una conferencia de R que para una conferencia en mi disciplina? ¿Qué tengo que incluir en la Bio? Para responder estas preguntas y compartir algunas recomendaciones para diseñar tu propuesta nos juntaremos el próximo sábado 1 de agosto :)<\/p> <p>- ¿Y si todavía no tengo una idea para una presentación?<\/p> <p>No importa. Durante la sesión hablaremos también sobre cómo generar ideas. Además, para el caso de algunas conferencias hay tiempo todavía. Quizás ahora mismo no se te ocurre nada en particular, pero puedes empezar a planear un proyecto para presentar en alguno de los eventos del próximo año.<\/p> <p>- ¿Qué necesito para participar?<\/p> <p>Lo primero, es leer nuestro código de conducta. Es requisito para asistir estar de acuerdo con él: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish<\/a>. Queremos que nuestros meetups sean un espacio seguro y amable en que todas las personas se sientan cómodas participando.<\/p> <p>Lo segundo, es asegurarte de que puedes utilizar la aplicación Zoom en tu computador. El día del taller te enviaremos el enlace para unirte (chequea ese día que el mensaje no se haya ido a la carpeta de spam). Usualmente compartimos el enlace 30 minutos antes de la sesión.<\/p> <p>- ¿Hay algo más que deba saber sobre este evento?<\/p> <p>Esta es una actividad organizada por los capítulos de RLadies de Chile en conjunto con LatinR (<a href=\"https://latin-r.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://latin-r.com/<\/a>), la Conferencia Latinoamericana sobre Uso de R en Investigación + Desarrollo. Queremos más representación de Latinoamérica en las conferencias de R alrededor del mundo y qué mejor que apoyarnos como comunidad para lograrlo.<\/p> <p>El taller estará a cargo de Riva Quiroga (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga<\/a>).<\/p> ",

We'll talk about three tools which both make it easier to handle bigger data locally and scale nicely to cloud architecture when required:<\/p> <p>1. Parquet. We all want more data, but nobody really wants a 281 Gb CSV. Parquet is a well-supported alternative that solves a lot of the problems with CSVs.<br/>2. Arrow Datasets. (Experimental!) What do you do when you've got more data than memory? Arrow Datasets are a really easy-to-use option to pull out what you need.<br/>3. Apache Drill. When you need a power tool, Drill lets you treat a hard drive like a database, putting the power of SQL at your fingertips without the setup.<\/p> <p>And thanks to our open-source community, they all work beautifully from R!

    "description": "<p>Join our next meetup, virtually!<\/p> <p>Jorge Cimentada | tidyflow: a simplified and fresh workflow for doing machine learning with tidymodels<\/p> <p>Machine Learning programming is hard. Managing your data, splitting, resampling, preprocessing, modeling, and grid search into different objects can prove to be difficult. One can predict on the testing data by mistake, forget whether the preprocessing has been applied to the data or not, or simply do not remember the name of all the tuning parameters to specify in the grid. The `tidyflow` package builds upon `tidymodels` to bundle all of these steps into a coherent flow. It gives the same flexibility as the separate `tidymodels` package but makes machine learning modeling much more linear. In this talk we’ll introduce the benefits of tidyflow and walk through some examples of how to use it.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>18:00 Intro<br/>18:05 Jorge's talk<br/>18:35 Q&amp;A<br/>19:00 Closing remarks<\/p> <p>----<br/>Bio: Jorge Cimentada<\/p> <p>PhD in Sociology from Pompeu Fabra University and currently a Research Scientist at the Laboratory of Digital and Computational Demography at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. His research is mainly focused on the study of educational inequality, inequality in spatial mobility and computational social science. He has worked on data science projects both in the private sector and in academic research and is interested in merging cutting edge machine learning techniques with classical social statistics. You can check out his blog at cimentadaj.github.io or contact him through twitter at @cimentadaj.<\/p> ",

You’re not alone! Fortunately, there are best practices that you can adopt to help you develop more reproducible R code. In this talk, I’ll share some of these best practices, and then describe how the R package workflowr (<a href=\"https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/<\/a>) automates these tasks for you so that you can focus on your analyses. The workflowr framework combines R Markdown for literate programming and Git for version control. I’ll demonstrate how workflowr makes it easier for you to organize your project files, version your code, and share your results online.<\/p> <p>John Blischak is a Freelance Scientific Software Developer based out of Akron, Ohio, USA. He received his PhD in Genetics from the University of Chicago, where he became interested in reproducible and transparent computational workflows. Along with co-authors Peter Carbonetto and Matthew Stephens, he has developed the R package workflowr to facilitate reproducible research and promote open science.<\/p> ",

However, most companies struggle with preparing large datasets for analytics, managing the proliferation of ML frameworks, and moving models in development to production.<\/p> <p>In this free virtual, half-day workshop on Sept. 2nd, we’ll cover best practices for enterprises to use powerful open source technologies to simplify and scale your data and ML efforts. We’ll go over how to:<\/p> <p>- Build highly scalable and reliable pipelines for analytics with Delta Lake<br/>- Train a model against data and learn best practices for working with ML frameworks (i.e. - TensorFlow, XGBoost, Scikit-Learn, etc.)<br/>- Track experiments, share projects and deploy models in the cloud and on-prem with MLflow<br/>- And you'll get a chance to interact with your peers - data engineers, data scientists, business analysts, and developers who are on their journey to scale ML efforts in their organizations.<\/p> <p>Seats are limited, so be sure to register here today: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3gQ5E3R\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/3gQ5E3R<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Register here: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2CCeoMe\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2CCeoMe<\/a><\/p> <p>Euphoria Convenience is big data and predictive analytics perfectly attuned: it means satisfying goods and services arriving even before consumers sense that they want them. Already we see slivers of it on Netflix when the next, curated video begins even before the previous one ends. We experience it on Amazon when suggestions occasionally fulfill an urge we didn’t know we had.<\/p> <p>The key to perfected entertainment and service is our personal information, and the underlying human dilemma is about how much of ourselves we should expose to get what we want. In this webinar, real world cases and philosophical thought experiments will help us investigate by exploring questions including: What is privacy? Why is Kim Kardashian the most private person in the world? Is it more satisfying to want and then get, or to get before wanting? Answers are elusive, but the goal is to identify and clarify the ethical dilemmas arising when personal information is gathered and leveraged in the media, entertainment, marketing and retail sectors. This webinar is tailored for professionals in data governance, but open to all those interested in the regulatory and human dilemmas inhabiting privacy and AI powered convenience.<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2CCeoMe\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2CCeoMe<\/a><\/p> ",

In this talk we're going to cover what makes the command line useful, practical work flows (live demos), picking a terminal and shell, customizing your prompt, using and configuring tools like tmux and Vim, the concept of dotfiles and if time permits using various Unix tools together to solve real world problems. By the end of the talk you'll be well on your way to having a tricked out command line focused development environment.<\/p> <p>About Nick:<br/>Nick Janetakis is a developer and sysadmin. He is an independent freelancer, course creator and hosts the Running in Production podcast. Nick also has hundreds of blog posts and YouTube videos focused on building and deploying web apps along with development environment tips and tricks.

The workshop will cover handy one time functions (i.e., use_this::create_package) as well as functions used continuously throughout package development (i.e., devtools::document). At the end of the hour you should have a working, well-documented package with a single function, as well as a better understanding of the files and file structure required for R packages.<\/p> <p>This workshop is suitable for beginner to intermediate R users. Attendees should be familiar with functions, but will not be writing their own function in this workshop. Familiarity with pipe or tidyverse is helpful.<\/p> <p>Speaker<\/p> <p>Shannon Pileggi is an enthusiastic statistical collaborator and professional educator with over ten years of experience partnering on data analysis with diverse stakeholders in corporate settings, tech, public health, and clinical research.

At its core, racism is a powerful system that creates false hierarchies of human value; its warped logic extends beyond race, from the way we regard people of different ethnicities or skin colors to the way we treat people of different sexes, gender identities, and body types. Racism intersects with class and culture and geography and even changes the way we see and value ourselves. In How to Be an Antiracist, Kendi takes readers through a widening circle of antiracist ideas--from the most basic concepts to visionary possibilities--that will help readers see all forms of racism clearly, understand their poisonous consequences, and work to oppose them in our systems and in ourselves. Kendi weaves an electrifying combination of ethics, history, law, and science with his own personal story of awakening to antiracism. This is an essential work for anyone who wants to go beyond the awareness of racism to the next step: contributing to the formation of a just and equitable society. Praise for How to Be an Antiracist \"Ibram X. Kendi's new book, How to Be an Antiracist, couldn't come at a better time. . . . Kendi has gifted us with a book that is not only an essential instruction manual but also a memoir of the author's own path from anti-black racism to anti-white racism and, finally, to antiracism. . . . How to Be an Antiracist gives us a clear and compelling way to approach, as Kendi puts it in his introduction, 'the basic struggle we're all in, the struggle to be fully human and to see that others are fully human.' \"--NPR \"Kendi dissects why in a society where so few people consider themselves to be racist the divisions and inequalities of racism remain so prevalent. How to Be an Antiracist punctures the myths of a post-racial America, examining what racism really is--and what we should do about it.\"--Time<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

You’re not alone! Fortunately, there are best practices that you can adopt to help you develop more reproducible R code. In this talk, I’ll share some of these best practices, and then describe how the R package workflowr (<a href=\"https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/<\/a>) automates these tasks for you so that you can focus on your analyses. The workflowr framework combines R Markdown for literate programming and Git for version control. I’ll demonstrate how workflowr makes it easier for you to organize your project files, version your code, and share your results online.<\/p> <p>John Blischak is a Freelance Scientific Software Developer based out of Akron, Ohio, USA. He received his PhD in Genetics from the University of Chicago, where he became interested in reproducible and transparent computational workflows. Along with co-authors Peter Carbonetto and Matthew Stephens, he has developed the R package workflowr to facilitate reproducible research and promote open science.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>About the instructor: Join Dr. Maria C. Ramos, a Visiting Research Fellow at Duke Network Analysis Center (www.mariacramos.com), for her workshop on network analysis. Maria Ramos is a social scientist and networks scholar. She recently obtained a PhD in Sociology from Duke University and is now a Visiting Research Fellow at Duke Network Analysis Center. Maria’s research portfolio is diverse and interdisciplinary. Her current projects employ network science to understand HIV prevention, social-ecological systems, collaboration within organizations, and networks of beliefs and mental models. Maria regularly consults with organizations and research teams interested in leveraging network analysis to solve applied problems. She is also an avid R user and loves developing and teaching R workshops and tutorials.<\/p> <p>Workshop description: We live in an interconnected world: from the Web, transportation systems, and disease spread to our friendships and families, many aspects of our lives consist of interdependencies and connections among entities. Network analysis provides a framework and a set of tools for studying systems and patterns of relationships. This workshop will provide a gentle introduction to network analysis' concepts, methods, and applications. We will begin with an overview of the networks approach and its applications in various disciplines. Through hands-on activities, we will visualize networks and assess their general structure using different indices. We will also identify subgroups and key players. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to examine networks and characterize their properties using R.<\/p> <p>Details: We will post or send out zoom links and materials closer to the event date.<\/p> ",
