    "description": "<p>Selecting test exercises with an appropriate difficulty level is one of the most important aspects of a high-quality assessment, but how do we know how difficult a given exercise is? <\/p> <p>One of the possible approaches is to use Item Response Theory - a set of psychometric models which can be used to estimate learners’ proficiency and parameters of each exercise. This approach works well in most cases, however, is data intensive. So, the question arises what to do when we don't have enough data, when for example, we are introducing some new exercises.<\/p> <p>Fortunately, probabilistic programming comes to our aid. Using Greta, we can build a custom IRT model, that allows us to quantify how different features of exercises impact their difficulty. In this talk, we will introduce the audience to the basics of IRT and probabilistic programming through a real-world application - estimating the difficulty of English tasks. For this purpose, we will use the previously mentioned Greta package, which lets us write statistical models in native R and sample from them automatically and efficiently.<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://xeurope-exercises.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://xeurope-exercises.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Damian Wiatrzyk<br/>LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-wiatrzyk-91803072/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-wiatrzyk-91803072/<\/a><\/p> <p>Damian Wiatrzyk graduated from the Poznań University of Technology with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

S4 classes in R give structure to your data and help you organize your methods. They also help signal to your team members proper use of the data structures you define and what methods are available, in essence, how to use your code properly, and also, how to add to it or modify it later on.<\/p> <p>In this talk, we will empower ourselves by reminding ourselves that data scientists are a particular class of programmers (distinct from those who create PC/console games, those who create mobile apps, those who create websites, etc) but programmers all the same. Then we will briefly discuss the benefits of code encapsulation, especially with respect to packages and S4 classes while touching briefly on other OOP systems in R. We will discuss when and how to implement them, and how to structure your code base in a clean, effective, and consistent manner so that it's clear and easy to understand for your teammates and to yourself.<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Ezra Tucker is the Director of Data Science at Energetic Insurance<\/p> <p>Energetic Insurance is a Managing General Underwriter (MGU) with a novel, data-driven approach to develop new risk management products to unlock exponential growth in the renewable energy industry<\/p> ",

NLP models are great at processing digital text, but many real-word applications use documents with more complex formats. For example, healthcare systems often include visual lab results, sequencing reports, clinical trial forms, and other scanned documents. When we only use an NLP approach for document understanding, we lose layout and style information - which can be vital for document image understanding. New advances in multi-modal learning allow models to learn from both the text in documents (via NLP) and visual layout (via computer vision).<\/p> <p>We provide multi-modal visual document understanding, built on Spark OCR based on the LayoutLM architecture. It achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy in several downstream tasks, including form understanding (from 70.7 to 79.3), receipt understanding (from 94.0 to 95.2) and document image classification (from 93.1 to 94.4).<\/p> <p>Register Here: <a href=\"https://events.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-document-understanding-with-multi-modal-image-text-mining-in-spark-ocr-3\" class=\"linkified\">https://events.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-document-understanding-with-multi-modal-image-text-mining-in-spark-ocr-3<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>This talk will focus on the use of smoothing splines to detect patterns in time-series data. Smoothing splines can be easily used in R to smooth complex data and reduce noise. Through interpolation, the resulting splines can be used to construct high resolution data sets that are more amenable to automated analysis for pattern detection. The application of smoothing splines will be covered in three parts: 1) the key parameters and coding of smoothing splines in R will be discussed using a Shiny app designed to determine inflection points in chemical titrations, 2) a method for detecting complex patterns in time-series data will be discussed using a model designed to identify the ‘Cup and Handle’ pattern in stock prices, and 3) a theoretical discussion of potential applications to generate input and output data for supervised and unsupervised learning.<\/p> <p>Presenter: Dr. Fred Franken<\/p> <p>Fred Franken, Ph.D., has over 15 years of experience in data analysis.

    "description": "<p>When we make an inventory of opportunities to add value to organizations with data, often there is low hanging fruit that does not require much investment in actual data analysis, but can be solved by automating data aspects of business processes. In fact there is a whole industry around this called robotic process automation (RPA). But where RPA offers a low-code approach to setting up automation tasks, it is easy to undervalue R for setting up these tasks with R code.<\/p> <p>In this talk I would like to share some of the experiences we have had automating tasks with R. The tools we use range from great packages like fs to work with the filesystem on the R side. But there are also packages to make it easier to work with cron jobs on Linux (cronR) and the task scheduler on Windows (taskscheduleR).<\/p> <p>When you combine this with other tools of the automation trade like httr to access API's or plumber to write API's there is practically no limit to what you can achieve using only R and readily available tools on linux and windows. I hope that the talk will inspire a lively discussion where we share experiences and ideas about automating processes with R.<\/p> <p>Frans van Dunné (<a href=\"https://www.fransvandunne.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.fransvandunne.com/<\/a>) is Chief Data Officer at ixpantia (<a href=\"https://www.ixpantia.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ixpantia.com/<\/a>). He combines a diverse skill-set, that includes business analysis, data analysis and enterprise architecture, with more than 15 years of experience to help organizations respond to their data driven innovation needs quickly and effectively. Frans has a PhD in biology from the University of Amsterdam and has taught at universities in Europe and Latin America. As a consultant he has worked with companies around the world on diverse topics, including data driven innovation, applied statistics, statistical programming and machine learning.<\/p> <p>Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>The job of a data engineer is to build, manage, and optimize systems for transforming data into forms that facilitate analysis. Despite the broad adoption of R as a language for data science, it has taken a back seat to Python and other languages in the area of data engineering. But this is beginning to change. Data engineering tasks that were previously infeasible in R are becoming straightforward thanks to recent developments in the Apache Arrow project and the R package `arrow`. Arrow provides tools for working with tabular data that emphasize performance, efficiency, standardization, and interoperability with other languages and systems in the broader data ecosystem. Using the R package `arrow`, it is now possible to implement many data engineering and ETL tasks entirely in R, avoiding the overhead of switching to another language Python or using a framework like Spark.<\/p> <p>All skill levels are welcomed.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30pm - 6:40pm Introductions<br/>6:40pm - 7:20pm Topic Presentation<br/>7:20pm - 7:30pm Closing Remarks<\/p> <p>(Topic presentations sometimes run longer than 40 minutes)<\/p> <p>This meetup will be 100% virtual!

    "description": "<p>Hello R-Ladies!<\/p> <p>Join us on May 12th for a workshop on developing R packages!<\/p> <p>Event Description: R packages are a collection of functions, documentation, and sample data. Not only do they provide an excellent framework for organizing your code, but they also make it easier to share code with other R users. In this workshop, we’ll develop a simple R package together to gain an understanding of the key steps of package development. I’ll also reflect on my experiences creating an internal package for my team at the BC Ministry of Health. I hope to shed light on the lesser-known non-technical aspects of package development by discussing how to identify what tools your teammates need to succeed and how to encourage them to adopt your package. This workshop is geared towards (but not limited to) those who are new to developing packages and those who are thinking of creating one to share within their organization and beyond.<\/p> <p>**This workshop assumes you know how to write a function in R and are familiar with the RStudio IDE. (See below for resources and required packages) ***<\/p> <p>About the Speaker: Reiko is a data analyst with the Government of British Columbia. In her role, she creates various tools using R to support her team’s work in monitoring trends in population health and health inequalities in the province.

Learn how to best structure your model workflows including reading in data, checking the data, performing analyses, and plotting. The presentation will also go into more advanced topics discussing the R-INLA package for modelling spatio-temporal data. R-INLA is a powerful method that uses integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to create complex models with various types of random effects such as spatial and temporal autocorrelation and run them very fast (<a href=\"https://www.r-inla.org/home\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.r-inla.org/home<\/a>). In this talk, we will specially focus on how to model spatial autocorrelation using coral recovery data. Best for those who are comfortable with R but all are welcome.<\/p> <p>*Who is going to present:<br/>Dr. Julie Vercelloni is a quantitative ecologist that studied Marine Ecology during her undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and statistics applied to coral reef ecology for her PhD. She is now an Associate Investigator at the Queensland University of Technology node of the Australian Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers and works mostly with the Australian Institute of Marine Science.<br/>Julie is doing research on diverse projects that look at combining state-of-the-art technologies including machine learning and virtual reality, and modern statistical modelling methods to help understanding complex problems related to coral reef conservation. She is also a citizen science advocate, working on new types of monitoring for the Great Barrier Reef and Pacific countries.<\/p> <p>* When are we meeting?<br/>The talk will start at 5:30 pm for a ~45 minute presentation, 15 minutes Q&amp;A time with the potential to move to an outside venue for continued socializing and networking.<\/p> <p>* Where are we meeting?<br/>We will meet at QUT Gardens Point campus room Y-801 (in building Y) - this will be a hybrid event with a Zoom link available.<br/>map: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/4H51oEEun6JuewVn6\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/4H51oEEun6JuewVn6<\/a><br/>DIRECTIONS TO THE ROOM - Y block/building is next to River Stage in QUT Gardens Point.

Social vulnerability is defined as the resilience of communities when dealing with external stresses on health, such as age, housing, race/ethnicity, and more. For analysis, we used multiple linear regression to determine which social vulnerability variables are most directly related with hospital capacity in each county in California, using average bed utilization rate as our measure of hospital capacity. The significant predictors from our model were: the proportion of the county’s population under 17, the percentage of individuals reporting severe housing situations, the proportion of the county's population that are Black, the percentage of single parent households, and the percentage of households with more people than rooms. We then developed a county-level social vulnerability index (SVI) and concluded that there was a relationship between the SVI and COVID-19 case prevalence per county after mapping both of them using Tableau. Our findings suggest that more socially vulnerable counties are less equipped to handle impacts of COVID-19 and more resources should be allocated to them to establish equitable health outcomes. This project was originally created in May 2020, with updates to COVID case rates in December 2020.<\/p> <p># Predicting Benzodiazepines Use<br/>Speakers: Tiffany Feng, Eustina Kim, Diana Pham, Kienna Qin<br/>Seniors, Department of Statistics, UCLA<\/p> <p>Bio: Tiffany Feng, UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Digital Humanities minor; Eustina Kim: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Digital Humanities minor; Diana Pham: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Global Health minor; Kienna Qin: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major<\/p> <p>Abstract: This project explores which characteristics among students, health care professionals, and veterans determined the use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) in a sample of participants in the United States during 2018. BZDs are a type of drug that produces sedation and lowers anxiety levels. They are the most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., and, unfortunately, are frequently abused and taken with other drugs. We used multinomial logistic regression and various data visualizations to determine that having a history of drug use, mental illness, and prescriptions for opioids for treating pain are important in predicting the use of BZD for all three occupations in our sample. The largest impacts for each occupation were a history of drug use for students, mental illness and opioid prescriptions for pain for veterans, and there were similar influences for each category for health professionals. Although our data was not a representative sample, this could still demonstrate the importance of investigating the unique differences in determining BZD use for each occupation, which could lead into interventions such as targeted programs to reduce BZD misuse in each occupation. Hopefully with these insights, we can make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by the misuse of BZDs in the United States.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with. You will be able to create new columns and summary tables, subset interesting rows or columns, and combine and reshape dataframes. We will also dive into ggplot, one of the best tools for creating great-looking bar charts, scatterplots, and more!<\/p> <p>This is (currently) a five-part series, aimed at total beginners and/or people with some experience in base-R or tidyverse who are looking to freshen up or expand their skills. Feel free to join at any point, we will briefly review the previous topic at the beginning of each session.<\/p> <p>January 20th {Part 1}: The R &amp; R-Studio ABCs (packages, files, data types &amp; basic data exploration)<br/>February 17th {Part 2}: Tidy data &amp; introduction to data wrangling (tibbles, renaming, reordering, subsetting)<br/>March 17th {Part 3}: Data wrangling with dplyr (new columns, if-else statements, summary tables, joining dataframes)<br/>April 21st {Part 4}: Introduction to visualizations with ggplot (line graphs, bar charts, scatterplots, histograms, and more!)<br/>May 19th {Part 5}: Advanced topics in wrangling and ggplot (pivoting, ggplot style options, etc.)<\/p> <p>Please install R and R-Studio before joining: <a href=\"https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html<\/a><\/p> <p>Image by the amazing @allison_horst: <a href=\"https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations<\/a><\/p> ",

Hablaremos de las redes neuronales más famosas y por supuesto, de los principales usos que se les da hoy en día. Una vez que conozcamos esos usos, vamos a implementar una red neuronal en R, ¿vamos? sí, ya verás que no es tan difícil. Las redes neuronales aprenden a través de ejemplos, como tú y yo, y ahí está la clave.<\/p> <p>En esta ocasión contamos con la crack Clara Piniella, donde nos ha dejado esta bonita biografía para que conozcáis más sobre su trayectoria:<\/p> <p>Me presento, soy Clara Piniella Martínez, y podría resumirlo todo con que soy graduada en Administración y Dirección de Empresas por la Universidad de Málaga, pero, eso es solo el principio. Mi pasión por entender aquello que hace únicas a las personas, y cómo poder hacer esto un valor añadido para la empresa me llevó hasta Australia, Melbourne, donde tras 12 meses obtuve el Diploma de Liderazgo y Dirección. Conocimientos que durante un año y medio pude poner en práctica en el departamento de Recursos Humanos de la empresa LeasePlan. Es aquí donde descubro que estas personas, tú y yo, somos una fuente imparable de datos que bien gestionados pueden no quitarnos poder, sino dárnoslo. Por este motivo en octubre de 2019 decidí embarcarme en esta aventura del análisis de datos, el machine learning. Acabo de llegar, pero cada día tengo más claro que he llegado para quedarme, para aprender, para compartir lo que sé y para participar en esta, la revolución del siglo XXI.<\/p> <p>¡Os esperamos el 11 de mayo!<\/p> ",

They maintain the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. They nourish other living organisms and supply psychological benefits to humans as well, improving our moods and beautifying the landscape around us. But plants don’t just passively provide. They also take action.<\/p> <p>Beronda L. Montgomery explores the vigorous, creative lives of organisms often treated as static and predictable. In fact, plants are masters of adaptation. They “know” what and who they are, and they use this knowledge to make a way in the world. Plants experience a kind of sensation that does not require eyes or ears. They distinguish kin, friend, and foe, and they are able to respond to ecological competition despite lacking the capacity of fight-or-flight. Plants are even capable of transformative behaviors that allow them to maximize their chances of survival in a dynamic and sometimes unfriendly environment.<\/p> <p>Lessons from Plants enters into the depth of botanic experience and shows how we might improve human society by better appreciating not just what plants give us but also how they achieve their own purposes. What would it mean to learn from these organisms, to become more aware of our environments and to adapt to our own worlds by calling on perception and awareness? Montgomery’s meditative study puts before us a question with the power to reframe the way we live: What would a plant do?<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>For the June 1st edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Dr. Danica Slavish as our guest speaker. Dr. Slavish will introduce the topic of Latent Profile Analyses using the tidyLPA framework.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Latent Profile Analyses using tidyLPA<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: Do adolescents who try alcohol before age 15 have worse health in adulthood than those who try alcohol later in life? Are there different subtypes of COVID-19 symptoms? How do these subtypes predict hospitalization risk? What types of advertisements most strongly predict if someone buys a product?<\/p> <p>All these questions can be answered using the statistical technique, latent profile analysis (LPA). LPA is a powerful statistical tool to identify hidden clusters in your data based on a set of variables. LPA is superior to other data reduction techniques like k-means clustering in that it generates probabilities of group membership. In this talk, a brief introduction to LPA using the R package tidyLPA will be covered. Using sample data on daily sleep patterns of nurses, we will walk through an example using the current gold standard 3-step approach: 1) estimate class membership, 2) extract class probabilities, 3) examine predictors of class membership. Best practices and advantages and disadvantages of LPA will be discussed.<\/p> <p>Bio: Dr. Danica Slavish is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of North Texas. Danica’s research focuses on how sleep problems and stressful life experiences interact to predict health outcomes across time. Her research team uses a variety of statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal data in R, including multilevel modeling, time-varying effect modeling, network analyses, and Bayesian analyses.

The model consists of two parts:<br/>A model for the election outcome (i.e. the vote share for each party based on poll data) and a model to assign a probability to the coalition of the actual government using expert survey data. An in-depth description and motivation is discussed in this talk.

UI plays a huge role in the success of Shiny projects. shiny.fluent enables you to build Shiny apps in a novel way using Microsoft’s Fluent UI as the UI foundation. It gives your app a beautiful, professional look and a rich set of components while retaining the speed of development that Shiny is famous for.<\/p> <p>Fluent UI is based on the Javascript library React, so it’s a challenging task to make it work with Shiny. We have put the parts responsible for making this possible in a separate package called shiny.react, which enables you to port other React-based components and UI libraries so that they work in Shiny.<\/p> <p>During the talk we will demonstrate how to use shiny.fluent to build your own Shiny apps, and explain how we solved the main challenges in integrating React and Shiny<\/p> <p>Speaker Bio:<br/>Kamil is a Full Stack Engineer at Appsilon. He graduated with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Warsaw. He is passionate about working across various technologies, leading projects, and developing internal tooling. Privately, he enjoys listening to<br/>jazz and has an interest in psychology and philosophy.<\/p> ",

You built another AI model that will never see the light of day because it won’t make it past the AI “valley of death” – the crossover of model development to model deployment across your enterprise. The handoff between data science and engineering teams is fraught with friction, outstanding questions around governance and accountability, and who is responsible for different parts of the pipeline and process. Even worse? The patchwork approach when building an AI pipeline leaves many organizations open to risks because of a lack of a holistic approach to security and monitoring.<\/p> <p>Join us to learn about approaches and solutions for configuring a ModelOps pipeline that’s right for your organization. You’ll discover why it’s never too early to plan for operationalization of models, regardless of whether your organization has 1, 10, 100, or 1,000 models in production.<\/p> <p>The discussion will also reveal the merits of an open container specification that allows you to easily package and deploy models in production from everywhere. Finally, new approaches for monitoring model drift and explainability will be revealed that will help manage expectations with business leaders all through a centralized AI software platform called Modzy®.<\/p> <p>Register: <a href=\"https://info.datascience.salon/crossing-the-ai-valley-of-death-deploying-monitoring-models-in-production\" class=\"linkified\">https://info.datascience.salon/crossing-the-ai-valley-of-death-deploying-monitoring-models-in-production<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>This meetup we'll have two shorter talks by Jai Ranchod and Bryan Lewis. Details below.<\/p> <p>Talk 1: Jai Ranchod - Extract tabular data from PDFs with pdftools<\/p> <p>I'm going to be talking about how to pull tabular data out of a PDF based on partial string matching and some functions in the \"PDF Tools\" package. The need to do this presented itself when the president of the management company wanted a table of information for the 60+ properties in our portfolio and our software vendor said they could only give us PDFs of word docs.<\/p> <p>Jai (\"Jay\") Ranchod is currently an Operations and Financial Analyst are Rose Community Management, a property management firm based in NYC with offices in Independence, OH. I started using R at my previous job at Epic Systems which is an electronic healthcare record company as part of the quality control process on their cognitive computing products. Since then I have taken several online classes in R, data science, and machine learning including a professional certificate program in data science taught using R. I have a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Wooster and recently finished my MBA from John Carroll University.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Bryan Lewis - R and DuckDB<\/p> <p>DuckDB (<a href=\"https://duckdb.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://duckdb.org<\/a>) is a new embedded SQL database library in the spirit of other embedded databases like SQLite. Unlike SQLite, DuckDB uses a column-oriented data layout (like R data frames) and has a particular focus on performance for interactive data analysis. DuckDB's integration with R is so complete that it can work directly on in-memory language objects without copying. This lets you use DuckDB directly on R data frames, including excellent support for dplyr.<\/p> <p>I'll show some practical examples of R and DuckDB and share my thoughts how to best use these technologies together.<\/p> <p>Bryan Lewis is a mathematician, author of the irlba and threejs R packages, and coauthor of the recent CRC textbook \"A Computational Approach to Statistical Learning.\" He previously worked on Mike Stonebraker's open-source SciDB array database project.<\/p> <p>Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Our August Meetup will be a remote gathering; the Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Infographics are everywhere, and when well-designed can be a fantastic way of sharing data highlights in an engaging and visually appealing way to non-technical audiences. Typically infographics are custom made by a graphic designer who has been provided the numbers that will be represented in the graphic, and therefore can be time-intensive to produce. Producing more than one infographic of the same design to display different values (for instance, for different geographical areas) has a linear increase in production time for each n+1 graphic once the basic design time has been accounted for. This talk will describe a novel method for producing infographics using R that allows for dynamically adjusting the graphical elements based on any number of data values and rapidly producing bespoke versions. A walkthrough of the process used to create 3,142 custom infographics (one for each county in the US) will be presented to illustrate the process.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Zadra, PhD is a Director of Data Science at the non-profit Sorenson Impact Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. He combines his skills in statistics, programming, and data visualization with expertise in data privacy and policy to empower governments, nonprofits, and philanthropists working in a wide array of issue areas. His areas of focus include criminal justice data (including work with the PEW Charitable Trusts, Utah Department of Corrections, Utah Indigent Defense Commission, and Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice), early- and higher-education data including a multi-year project supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as other issue areas like homelessness or poverty, and has worked on many smaller projects building evaluations and impact measurements for a variety of social-good non-profits around the country. He received his doctorate from the University of Virginia, where he studied cognitive science and neuroscience and designed and conducted rigorous RCTs - and also fell in love with R way back in 2006!<\/p> ",

This month, Anna Spiers will be giving us an introduction to spatial data and map-making in R!<\/p> <p>From Anna: Working with spatial data can feel as finicky as caring for your favorite houseplant - your attempts to help are rejected despite following instructions, and you look longingly at friends' and colleagues' masterpieces (i.e., maps/plants). This talk will introduce spatial data broadly, and cover some of the basic workflows and troubleshooting steps in R. Specifically, we will work with vector data, focus on the `sp` and `sf` libraries, and produce an interactive map in R. Example data and code will be provided.<\/p> <p>We will be meeting over Zoom (Meeting link visible when you RSVP). Join us to connect with other R users in the Boulder area and learn some new techniques to apply in your work!<\/p> <p>We hope you'll also join our local Slack workspace to keep the R help and conversation flowing!

    "group": "R-Ladies Brisbane",
    "start": "2021-06-16",
    "description": "<p>*What are we going to learn:<br/>Docker is a platform for creating “containers” on your system. You can think of them like a mini system on your computer. They are completely self-contained, isolated environments on your system. These containers include their own operating system, application software, scripts, data, etc. Containers are useful for a lot of things, but here I’ll focus on a quick introduction to using Docker for reproducibility in R. I will demonstrate on how to set-up Docker, run R on a Docker container and few other use cases.<\/p> <p>*Who is going to present:<br/>Malindrie is a PhD candidate at the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland. She works on developing bioinformatics methods for the analysis of large-scale single-cell data using advanced statistical modelling and uses modern statistics tools to understand human disease. Malindrie completed her Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree in Statistics in 2016.<\/p> <p>* When are we meeting?<br/>The talk will start at 5:00 pm for approximately 45 mins and 15 min Q&amp;A. After that we invite you to stay for in-person and/or virtual catch up.<\/p> <p>************The presentation will start at 5:00 pm********************<br/>* Where are we meeting?<br/>We will meet at study room 01-W227, Law Library (Walter Harrison Library), UQ St. Lucia campus- this will be a hybrid event with a Zoom link available.<br/>map: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/5AmevJ4dqiDUtkEn7\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/5AmevJ4dqiDUtkEn7<\/a><\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there!<\/p> <p>R-Ladies Brisbane<\/p> <p>********************************************************************************<br/>Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: Photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community.

    "description": "<p>Text is one of the most prominent and extensive data sources in the digital world. It can be an insight into consumer opinions, social media trends, and literary story arches. However, it can be difficult to analyze without specialized tools and commands. The tidytext package and framework makes it easy to go from full text files to clean data and ultimately, analysis!<\/p> <p>The workshop will start with the building blocks of text analysis: separating a text into smaller chunks, removing punctuation, and identifying frequent words or phrases. If you’ve joined our previous text analysis meetups before, this will be a great recap; if you haven’t, this will bring you right up to speed! We’ll show you all you need to know so beginners to the topic are very much welcome.<\/p> <p>The focus for the evening will be on going beyond individual words in isolation to n-grams: units of a set number of words (e.g. bigrams like “I think”, “think that”, “that tidytext”, “tidytext is”, “is great”.). This will allow us to get a sense of context about words based on the company they keep and address typical text analysis problems (e.g. \"happy\" preceded by \"not\" being given a positive sentiment score).<\/p> <p>We’ll top it all off with some truly unique visualizations that show the relationship between words, like bigram network plots with ggraph. Materials will be based on the book Tidy Text Mining by Julia Silge and David Robinson (chapter 4).<\/p> ",

The model consists of two parts:<br/>A model for the election outcome (i.e. the vote share for each party based on poll data) and a model to assign a probability to the coalition of the actual government using expert survey data. An in-depth description and motivation is discussed in this talk. The model is fitted with (R)Stan, a Bayesian modeling framework, that can seamlessly be integrated into R.<\/p> <p># Agenda<br/>19:30 Intro<br/>19:35 Talk<br/>20:05 Q&amp;A<br/>20:30 Closing remarks (we can extend it if needed)<\/p> <p># Bios<br/>Marcus Groß and Michelle Golchert are Data Scientists at INWT Statistics.<br/>Marcus holds a Ph.D. in Statistics and has several years experience consulting on and managing projects in the data science field.

Esta situación se da muy a menudo y provocará que la forma en la que hemos de testear los resultados sea muy particular. También veremos que la creación de visualizaciones de datos y la generación de gráficos, se convertirá en una parte esencial de la exploración de dichos resultados.<\/p> <p>Lo que obtendremos tras el proceso de clusterizacióon será una segmentación de los datos en grupos similares que serán lo que conocemos como “clústeres”. Aunque es un problema de clasificación no debemos confundir clusterización con clasificación. Ambos son métodos de identificación de patrones, pero mientras el primero pertenece al aprendizaje no supervisado, el segundo, más conocido, pertenece al aprendizaje supervisado. También trataremos de explicar estas diferencias.<\/p> <p>Además de resolver algunos casos prácticos durante la sesión, veremos cómo estos métodos pueden solucionar diferentes problemas en múltiples ámbitos (en medicina para el diagnóstico de enfermedades, en redes sociales para encontrar grupos de comportamiento similares, en finanzas para generar estrategias dirigidas a los diferentes grupos de clientes...)<\/p> <p>Todo esto lo haremos en el entorno de programación R en el que existen múltiples paquetes que implementan algoritmos de clustering y funciones para visualizar sus resultados.

Isn’t the statement that R is ‘just a research-only language mainly used by academia’ outdated?<\/p> <p>Spoiler alert: you definitely can use R in production. From ETL to (Shiny) web applications to machine learning models: some of the main business processes at Analytic Health are powered by R. During this talk, Veerle will dive into what “production” means and how you can use R in a context outside of academia. By showing how R is being used at Analytic Health and how processes and applications are deployed and managed we hope to show you that R can do more than statistics only. This talk will inspire you to take R one step further, and by providing pointers to which tools you can use to build robust processes you’ll leave this talk ready to use R in production yourself!<\/p> <p>ABOUT VEERLE<br/>---------------------<\/p> <p>Veerle is an entrepreneur and Data Scientist who gets excited about data and programming. She is Managing Director and Head of Data Science at Analytic Health, a UK-based company that develops intelligent and accessible technology which gives organisations the tools they need to accelerate innovation in healthcare. She is a R developer with a Master’s Degree in Data Science and multiple years of experience in the pharmaceutical market. Besides programming in R (and Shiny) she also develops multiple web applications for healthcare organisations using Vue.js and Node.<\/p> ",

This is motivated by my own obsession with colors and my own experience that different plots with different audiences respond differently to different themes.<\/p> <p>Bio: Anna Sofia Kircher is the data scientist at Lendable and works with data of various fintechs in emerging and frontier markets.<\/p> <p>“Does your color palette match your data?”<br/>Speaker: Joyce Robbins<\/p> <p>Abstract: One of the most common graphical mistakes is choosing an inappropriate color scheme for your data. In this talk, I’ll explain how sequential, diverging and qualitative color schemes are each suited to a different type of data. We’ll then look at a variety of plots that could be improved with alternative color choices. My hope is that these examples will serve as conversation starters for a lively discussion on matching color to data.<\/p> <p>Bio: Joyce Robbins (@jtrnyc) is a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University.
