In regression analysis, the nature of the data dictates which model type is appropriate. Models differ depending on the distribution of the response variable. This workshop will introduce four types of models in which the distributions of the response variable are: (i) normal (continuous, with bell-shaped density function), (ii) gamma (continuous, with density having a long right tail), (iii) binary (discrete, assuming values 0 or 1), and (iv) Poisson (discrete, assuming values 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.). For each regression, a definition and all must-know facts will be discussed. Further, the expression for the fitted model will be explained and how to interpret estimated regression coefficients will be taught. You will be shown how to use the model for prediction. The course will give examples in R and you will be taught how it create these models and interpret the output. You will work in small groups to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material.<\/p> <p>We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be setup and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.<\/p> <p>*Schedule*<br/>6:30-6:40 Introduction<br/>6:40-7:10 Normal Linear Regression<br/>6:10-8:00 Gamma Regression<br/>8:00-8:10 Break<br/>8:10-8:50 Logistic Regression<br/>8:50-9:30 Poisson Regression<br/>9:30-9:45 Wrap up<\/p> <p>*Venue*<br/>This event will be held on Zoom.

    "description": "<p>Hi Colchester UseRs!<\/p> <p>Happy to say we have a great speaker booked for this month that will show us how to teach others how to use R using videos.<\/p> <p>Speaker: Dr. Ed Ryan, Department of Mathematics, University of Manchester<\/p> <p>Title: Tips and advice for teaching R to non-R users using online videos.<\/p> <p>Abstract: I’ve been using R since 2008 and in the past four years I’ve been interested in creating training resources to teach R to people who need it for their work (e.g. PhD students) but weren’t taught it as part of their undergraduate degree. Due to the pandemic, I’ve decided to record the training and put it on YouTube. At the moment I’ve put together videos for the first four sessions of my ‘Learning R course’ with the final two videos planned for later this year. In this talk I’ll give a quick overview of the entire six sessions, including the fourth session where I wrote a model in R that simulates the first innings of a Twenty20 cricket match. I’ll also give some tips and advice on the practical side of creating videos to post on YouTube, such as what kind of microphone to use, how to do screen capture, whether video editing software is needed and which ones are best and affordable, etc. The talk will be accessible and hopefully useful to people from all experience levels in R, from beginners to experts.<\/p> <p>Please RSVP and a link will be posted and emailed out the day of the talk.<\/p> ",

After a quick intro to machine learning and the GBM algorithm, I will show how easy it is to train and then use GBMs in real-life business applications using some the most popular open source implementations (xgboost, lightgbm and h2o). We’ll do all this in both R and Python with only a few lines of code and this talk will be accessible for a wide audience (with limited prior knowledge of machine learning). Finally, in the last part of the talk I will provide plenty of references that can get you to the next level. GBMs are a powerful technique to have in your machine learning toolbox, because despite all the latest hype about deep learning (neural nets) and “AI”, in fact GBMs usually outperform neural networks on structured/tabular data most often encountered in business applications.<\/p> <p>OUR SPEAKER<\/p> <p>Szilard Pafka, PhD<br/>Chief Scientist, Epoch (USA)<\/p> <p>Szilard studied Physics in the 90s and obtained a PhD by using statistical methods to analyze the risk of financial portfolios.

R programmers spend time dealing with the operational details of data analysis, such as user support, visual cosmetics, modifications of visuals for publications of non programmers and deployment of workflows and data for non programmers publications. The pressure is even more acute when the ratio of non programmers to R programmers is large. R programmers generally wish to be liberated from operational tasks in order to focus more intensely on research such as data algorithms and new techniques.<\/p> <p>Tercen liberates the R programmer by offering a unique and novel visual computing paradigm and a unique R plug-in architecture and data model. Additionally it brings concepts such as, incremental visualization and data source derivation and more. I will present R Tercen use cases where I outline the liberation and empowerment of researchers.<\/p> <p># ABOUT THE SPEAKER - Faris Naji<\/p> <p>Faris is strongly committed to helping science progress, he believes in removing barriers for people who may not have quantitative skill sets. This is essential for open science. Faris has worked over 15 years with non programmers to bring tools and approaches into their workflows. Faris is a director of bioinformatics in a biotech company which enerates large amounts of molecular measurements and has seen first-hand the issues it brings. Faris is a co-founder of an early stage startup company called Tercen to address gaps in the area of collaborative data analysis and open science<\/p> ",

Did you know that R has a vast amount of tools available for executing traditional data engineering and workflow tasks? We don’t buy the narrative that Python is the only “production-quality” data science language and will showcase R’s ability to interface with the command line, manage files and directories, access environmental variables, talk to SQL databases, and more!<\/p> <p>Michael Thomas is the Chief Data Scientist at Ketchbrook Analytics, a software and analytics consulting firm out of Hartford, CT. He holds a B.S. in Accounting and Mathematics from Stonehill College, and an M.S. in Business Intelligence &amp; Analytics from Saint Joseph’s University. He has worked across a multitude of industries during his career, including public accounting, marketing, banking, financial services, agriculture, insurance, and information technology. He is passionate about combining data, analytics, and software to help everyday businesses make better decisions and operate more efficiently.<\/p> <p>Talk #2<br/>Presented by Leo PeBenito<\/p> <p>This lightning talk is a brief introduction to computational methods for addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic using R and the tidyverse. The classic SIR model will be applied to the Johns Hopkins University CSSE data set. Elements of the tidyverse will be explored through three vignettes: analysis using dplyr and purrr, visualization using tidyr and ggplot2, and when to return a tibble from a function.<\/p> <p>Leo PeBenito's background is in chemistry and biophysics, and his favorite molecule is melittin. He currently works as a data scientist on topics related to signal processing and ML. Two people that inspire him are Esther Duflo and Hadley Wickham.<\/p> <p>Talk #3<br/>Presented by Arafath Hossain<\/p> <p>This talk is about how we used R to productionalize a predictive model that helps business users interact with the model and use it as a powerful tool in their decision making. This application enables the business users to interact with the data, slice and dice the data and recalculate predictions based on their input changes.<\/p> <p>Arafath Hossain is a data scientist at Illinois State University. Arafath received his bachelor in business administration from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh, then worked in the market research and telecommunication industry before moving to the US and completing his MS in Technology. He works as a data scientist helping business partners improve student retention by identifying at-risk students early and prescribing possible interventions.<\/p> <p>Talk #4<br/>Presented by David Zimmermann<br/>A brief introduction to the rintrojs package.<\/p> <p>This talk shows how you can use the rintrojs package to create tours for shiny applications. A guided tour allows the developer of an app to show its users how the UI is designed to be used and to thoroughly explain certain aspects of an app increasing the user experience. The talk gives a brief introduction to the package and also shows how rintrojs can work with shinydashboards, tables, or leaflet maps.<\/p> <p>David is a senior data scientist at Cologne Intelligence, a consulting firm specialised in software and data solutions, based in Cologne. He holds a PhD in economics/computational finance from the University of Witten/Herdecke, an MSc in Finance and Investment from the University of Edinburgh, UK, and a BA in economics and international politics from Zeppelin University, but eventually ventured off into data science, machine learning, and more and more R programming. He is interested in everything R related, be it the tidyverse, shiny, tidymodels, or raw performance using Rcpp.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Prettier R Graphs and Documents with {showtext}+{prettydoc}<\/p> <p>Description:<\/p> <p>In this talk I will introduce two R packages that aim at making your plots and R Markdown documents prettier. First, the {showtext} package makes it easy to use your favorite fonts in R plots with virtually any graphics device. The function interface is device-independent, and fonts can either come from a local machine or from an online repository such as Google Fonts.<\/p> <p>In the second part, I will introduce the {prettydoc} package that provides a number of alternative themes for R Markdown documents. They are designed to be good-looking yet small in size. There are also some unique features of {prettydoc} such as code highlighting options and offline math expressions.<\/p> <p>At the end of the talk, I will mention how to extend the two packages to fit your own need, for example creating a font package, or adding a new theme for {prettydoc}.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Yixuan Qiu is an assistant professor in the School of Statistics and Management at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). His research interests include statistical computing, deep learning models, and data visualization. Yixuan is an active software developer in the R community, and has authored and maintained many popular packages including RSpectra, RcppNumerical, recosystem, showtext, and prettydoc. Before joining SUFE, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He obtained his PhD in statistics from Purdue University in 2018.<\/p> <p>Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.<\/p> ",

The Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Visual representations of data inform how machine learning practitioners think, understand, and decide. Before charts are ever used for outward communication about a ML system, they are used by the system designers and operators themselves as a tool to make better modeling choices. Practitioners use visualization, from very familiar statistical graphics to creative and less standard plots, at the points of most important human decisions when other ways to validate those decisions can be difficult. Visualization approaches are used to understand both the data that serves as input for machine learning and the models that practitioners create. In this talk, learn about the process of building a ML model in the real world, how and when practitioners use visualization to make more effective choices, and considerations for ML visualization tooling.<\/p> <p>Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC where she works on open source modeling tools.

Hence, the idea that it can be a great tool for people who work offline, alone, with other kinds of files ends up flying under the radar for too many people. In this talk, I would like to showcase how Git can be a valuable tool for researchers in general, who often use R for data analysis instead of package development, as well as other tools for the production of presentation documents such as papers and slides.<\/p> <p># Get ready!<br/>The speaker strongly believes in learning by doing, so this will be a hands-on seminar.

As such, they're important because they have the potential to influence both the use and development of packages.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I'll argue that these counts are often inflated. This inflation occurs for two reasons. First, there are log entries that record downloads that are (often orders of magnitude) smaller than a package's source or binary file. Second, there are regular and repeated efforts to download all of the packages on CRAN. Together, the two create a systematic inflation that is negatively related to a package's popularity and positively related to its number of versions.<\/p> <p>I'll conclude by showing how I'm working to reduce the effect of this inflation on the R 'packageRank' package (CRAN and GitHub). For details about 'packageRank', see <a href=\"https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank#readme\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank#readme<\/a>. For an earlier treatment about download count inflation see <a href=\"https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/05/11/packagerank-intro/#inflationary-bias-of-download-counts\" class=\"linkified\">https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/05/11/packagerank-intro/#inflationary-bias-of-download-counts<\/a>.<br/>################<br/>Robert Horton<br/>Fake it Till You Make It: Simulating Data to Test and Learn About ML Algorithms<\/p> <p>It is really difficult to know if your machine learning approach has squeezed every bit of available information from a dataset - unless you created the dataset yourself and you know exactly what is in it! Hiding signals in simulated data and then trying to recover that information using machine learning can be a useful way to learn the capabilities and limitations of various ML algorithms. It also presents a good opportunity to introduce some of the standard functions for sampling, generating random numbers from various distributions, matrix manipulations, and so forth to people new to R programming.<\/p> <p>We'll focus on generating data to test feature selection approaches, explore the effects of distractor variables, get a better understanding of what \"feature importance\" means, and do our best to devise \"diabolical\" datasets to confuse particular algorithms.<\/p> <p>###############<br/>Felix Schildorfer<br/>Accounting and Data Stewardship<\/p> <p>For most organizations (small and large) digital transformation is something that has already happened. While they are continuously updating technologies, the migration from physical to digital record keeping has already been completed. This has led to increased automation across the board. While the effect of technology on business operations is straightforward to understand and project, as well as being increasingly familiar to end users, it is also important to recognize the effect digitization has on information distribution. End users of organizational data are increasingly accustomed to the ability to access and update information on an almost continuous basis from a variety of sources. Financial information is not excluded from such an evolution. The tools for managing this are starting to appear within the marketplace, data exists both inside and outside of organizations, and accountants have the necessary skills to effect change. The only next step is for professionals to seize the opportunity and leverage their skills and competencies to fully realize and maximize this moment.<\/p> <p>In this talk I will explore data governance in relation to accounting, \"true value\" of accounting information and the role of accountants in this changing and challenging world of big data.<\/p> ",

In fact, the R package “multiROC” implements such extensions. We will briefly discuss these extensions and consider the following question: if multiclass classification metrics can be used for problems with n classes, do they apply to the special case of binary classification, i.e. n=2?<\/p> <p>#<br/>R Horton<br/>Six Ways to Think About ROC Curves<br/>We will walk through six ways to understand ROC curves:<\/p> <p>1. The discrete \"Turtle's Eye\" view, where labeled cases are sorted by score, and the path of the curve is determined by the order of positive and negative cases.<\/p> <p>2. The categorical view, where we have to handle tied scores, or when scores put cases in sortable buckets.<\/p> <p>3. The continuous view, where the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the positive cases is plotted against the CDF for the negative cases.<\/p> <p>4. The ROC curve can be thought of as the limit of the cumulative gain curve (or \"Total Operating Characteristic\" curve) as the prevalence of positive cases goes to zero.<\/p> <p>5. The probabilistic view, where AUC is the probability that a randomly chosen positive case will have a higher score than a randomly chosen negative case.<\/p> <p>6. The ROC curve emerges from a graphical interpretation of the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon U Test Statistic, which illustrates how AUC relates to this commonly used non-parametric hypothesis test.<\/p> <p>Once we're covered how to think about ROC curves, we'll look at some examples of using them to diagnose issues with machine learning classifiers<\/p> <p>#<br/>J Mount<br/>How to Pick an Optimal Utility Threshold Using the ROC Plot<\/p> <p>One of the classic applications of the ROC plot is to encode the efficient frontier of optimal specificity and sensitivity tradeoffs for a given signal detection problem. We will show the classic derivation of how to translate concrete business goals into the ROC framework and then use the ROC plot to pick off the optimal classification threshold for a given problem. I will emphasize discovering utility requirements through iterated negotiation.<\/p> <p>A sneak peek of some of the points can be found here: <a href=\"https://win-vector.com/2020/10/10/how-to-pick-an-optimal-utility-threshold-using-the-roc-plot/\" class=\"linkified\">https://win-vector.com/2020/10/10/how-to-pick-an-optimal-utility-threshold-using-the-roc-plot/<\/a><\/p> <p>#<br/>N Zumel<br/>Squeezing the Most Utility from Your Models<\/p> <p>The ROC concisely expresses all the sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs achievable by a given probability (or other score-returning) model. Generally, one converts such a model into a \"hard\" classifier by picking a decision threshold. A good threshold balances classifier precision/recall or sensitivity/specificity in a way that best meets the project or business needs. Unfortunately, the ROC is not the best visualization for picking the optimal threshold.<\/p> <p>A more direct way to quantify and think about this optimal threshold is the notion of model utility, which maps the performance of a model to some notion of the value achieved by that performance. In this talke, we discuss how to estimate model utility and pick model thresholds for classification problems.<\/p> <p>For an advance peek at some of these ideas see here: <a href=\"https://win-vector.com/2020/10/05/squeezing-the-most-utility-from-your-models/\" class=\"linkified\">https://win-vector.com/2020/10/05/squeezing-the-most-utility-from-your-models/<\/a><\/p> ",

So in this talk, data validation will take centre stage, as we take a look at what it is (and is not), as well as some guiding principles, best practices and overall criteria to assess/ensure data validity. The talk will also cover several R packages aimed at this precise topic, for instance: {validate}, {assertr} and {ensurer}, as well as other related packages or functions, with examples provided as we go along. By the end of this talk, the aim is to have provided an overview on the principles and tools in this area, while highlighting the importance of the topic itself.<\/p> <p>About Caterina:<br/>Dr. Caterina Constantinescu is a data scientist working at Tesco Bank, whose past work ranges across areas such as research methods, national health data, occupational therapy, transport and data for good. Her academic background prior to this involved researching if various emotion-generating stimuli used in lab settings could approximate emotional states occurring in daily life. For several years she was also the organiser of the R meetup in Edinburgh (EdinbR), followed by organising the DataTech conference in 2019. Currently, her work focuses on writing Shiny apps that support data-driven decision-making across the bank.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 6 and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before.

    "description": "<p>Modeling and machine learning in R involve a bewildering array of heterogeneous packages, and establishing good statistical practice is challenging in any language. The tidymodels (tidymodels.org) collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, we’ll focus on three specific reasons to consider using tidymodels. We will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering.<\/p> <p>Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC where she works on open source modeling tools. She is an author, an international keynote speaker, and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice. Julia loves text analysis, making beautiful charts, and communicating about technical topics with diverse audiences.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>R-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community.<\/p> <p>A question we often get is \"Are men welcome to attend this event?\"<\/p> <p>As a diversity initiative, the mission of R-Ladies is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladies’ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting minority gender R enthusiasts to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.<\/p> <p>**As such, we strongly encourage cis-men who attend this event come as guests of R-Ladies who are minority genders (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender).**<\/p> <p>All attendees are strongly encouraged to review the R-Ladies Code of Confuct (<a href=\"https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct<\/a>) and must abide by it.<\/p> ",

As a first book, we chose to read and discuss Hadley Wickham's Advanced R book (<a href=\"https://adv-r.hadley.nz/\" class=\"linkified\">https://adv-r.hadley.nz/<\/a>).<br/>Join us for our next meeting, in which Janine Khuc will present the key points of Chapter 17: “Big Picture\"- that introduces us to the key concepts of metaprogramming, a powerful idea that deeply influences much R code. At the most basic level the idea is explored 'that code is data that can be inspected and modified programmatically'. We'll discover why we can write things like library(purrr) instead of library(\"purrr\") within R and many more things.<\/p> <p>You can find the full schedule and more information here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladiesnl/book_club\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladiesnl/book_club<\/a><\/p> <p>Feel free to sign up to discuss one of the chapters there!<\/p> <p>ABOUT Janine<br/>----------------------<br/>Janine is a data scientist and one of the R-Ladies Amsterdam co-founders. Within the data science world she loves the intricacies that come with data science in the medical world, involving messy data (generation) and medical decision making that go beyond the technical nitty gritty. With her background in psychology she is well equipped to thoroughly understand the the requirements that go into a well designed data science project. She entered the world of data science through R- where her love for the language and the community developed. Now she is busy bringing the community in Amsterdam together supporting others in achieving their full programming potential through R.<\/p> <p>REQUIREMENTS<br/>----------------------<br/>Make sure to read the chapter (17) in advance!<\/p> <p>LINK TO MEETUP<br/>———————————<br/>See on the right<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct.

These models focus on disaggregating within from between-person effects when modelling concurrent and temporal inter-relations between multiple repeated measures variables simultaneously. The two methods will be illustrated using data on children’s socio-emotional development from the Millennium Cohort Study.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Your Code As Data<\/p> <p>### Russ Hyde (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/haematobot\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/haematobot<\/a>)<\/p> <p>The code you write this month won’t stay still. You’ll eventually want to add extra features to that package or extra analyses to that project. You might find a bug or try to speed things up. Your tests might start to fail when dependencies change or your report might not build on a different system. As it evolves to accommodate these changes, it is worth reappraising your code. R has a range of tools to help assess your current code-base encompassing static analysis (style / syntax / structure: lintr, goodpractice, cyclocomp, pkgnet) and dynamic analysis (test coverage / benchmarking / profiling: covr, bench, profvis). For version-controlled projects, the git history can provide an archaeological and social view of the code base that complements analysis of the code itself. In this talk (inspired by Adam Tornhill’s book ‘Software Design X-Rays’), I show how existing R tools for working with git can be combined with code analysis tools to provide a rich dataset about your code.<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>/federico<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>About the instructor: Join Dr. Maria C. Ramos, a Visiting Research Fellow at Duke Network Analysis Center (www.mariacramos.com), for her workshop on network analysis. Maria Ramos is a social scientist and networks scholar. She recently obtained a PhD in Sociology from Duke University and is now a Visiting Research Fellow at Duke Network Analysis Center. Maria’s research portfolio is diverse and interdisciplinary. Her current projects employ network science to understand HIV prevention, social-ecological systems, collaboration within organizations, and networks of beliefs and mental models. Maria regularly consults with organizations and research teams interested in leveraging network analysis to solve applied problems. She is also an avid R user and loves developing and teaching R workshops and tutorials.<\/p> <p>Workshop description: We live in an interconnected world: from the Web, transportation systems, and disease spread to our friendships and families, many aspects of our lives consist of interdependencies and connections among entities. Network analysis provides a framework and a set of tools for studying systems and patterns of relationships. This workshop will provide a gentle introduction to network analysis' concepts, methods, and applications. We will begin with an overview of the networks approach and its applications in various disciplines. Through hands-on activities, we will visualize networks and assess their general structure using different indices. We will also identify subgroups and key players. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to examine networks and characterize their properties using R.<\/p> <p>PLEASE NOTE: We will be automatically recording this event. If you do *not* wish to be recorded, please be sure to keep your video/camera turned OFF.<\/p> ",

Furthermore, Sentinel-2 sensors, including 13 spectral bands in the visible and infrared wavelengths, provide very valuable information which can be used to automatically perform tasks such as classify crop types, assess forest changes, or monitor build-up area development. This is particularly important now, in the era of rapid changes in the environment related to climate change. In R, there are plenty of tools and packages which can be used for satellite images such as pre-processing, analyzing, and visualizing data in a simple and efficient way. Also, the variety of methods, such as machine learning algorithms, are available in R and can be applied in the analysis of satellite imagery. I would like to show the framework for acquiring, pre-processing and preliminary analysis of the Sentinel-2 time series in R. It includes the spectral indices calculation, the use of the machine learning algorithms in the classification of land cover, and, the analysis of time series of imagery, i.e. determining the changes in environment based on the spectral trajectories of pixels.<\/p> <p>Biography:<br/>Ewa is a Ph.D. candidate in geography at the Jagiellonian University, and a research assistant at the Faculty of Forestry, the University of Agriculture in Kraków. In her research, she focus on the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in determining different forest characteristics, such as tree species composition or detection of forest disturbances. She is also a big R enthusiast and she mostly use it in my analysis!<\/p> ",

I started learning R in 2014, taught my first R course in 2015. I started with a casual knowledge of data science, statistics, and matrix math.<\/p> <p>Since then, have taught more than 300 sessions to nearly 60,000 learners. I've covered matrices, NLP, linear models, program flow and other details of the R language.<\/p> <p>But enough about me - how about you? Let's discuss the objections I've heard about passing on your knowledge to the next generation. I'll cover the imposter syndrome, lack of venue, and \"I'm a researcher, not an educator.\"<\/p> <p>In ten minutes, you'll have your confidence restored and your awesomeness confirmed.<\/p> <p>Mark Niemann-Ross is an author &amp; educator. He teaches for LinkedIn Learning, focused on the R programming language and Raspberry Pi. He is the author of \"Stupid Machine\" - a science fiction murder mystery solved by a refrigerator.<\/p> ",

Il Meetup sarà orientato sia alla ricerca accademica e che al mondo delle startup.<\/p> <p>Lunedì 23 Novembre 2020, dalle ore 18.30 alle ore 20.00.<\/p> <p>REGISTRAZIONE OBBLIGATORIA SU CODEMOTION: <a href=\"https://community.codemotion.com/deep-learning-italia/meetups/meetup-aperitech-online-edition-di-novembre-di-deep-learning-italia\" class=\"linkified\">https://community.codemotion.com/deep-learning-italia/meetups/meetup-aperitech-online-edition-di-novembre-di-deep-learning-italia<\/a><\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Giovanna de Vincenzo Co-Founder @R-Ladies Bari | Data Scientist @InfoCamere<\/p> <p>Titolo: Dati personali e informazioni sensibili: tecniche di data anonymization in R<\/p> <p>Abstract<\/p> <p>Con i social media e i big data ovunque, la privacy dei dati è diventata una preoccupazione pubblica crescente. La raccolta di informazioni è necessaria per aiutare un sito web a crescere, targetizzare i clienti o analizzare fenomeni sociali. Riconoscendo questo problema, tante entità come Google e Apple, stanno promuovendo migliori tecniche di tutela e protezione della privacy. È qui che entra in gioco l'anonimizzazione dei dati.<\/p> <p>📣 Cos'è l'anonimizzazione dei dati e perché è importante?<\/p> <p>L'anonimizzazione dei dati rende non identificabili le informazioni identificabili. Ciò avviene tramite tecniche di elaborazione dati che rimuovono o codificano i dati personali. Quindi i dati diventano anonimi e non possono essere collegati a nessun individuo. L'anonimizzazione dei dati consente di rispettare i GDPR di tutto il mondo.<\/p> <p>In questo meetup esploreremo i metodi e le tecniche di base per la codifica dei dati che statistici e data scientist utilizzano per rendere anonimi i dati con R.<\/p> <p>Utilizzeremo il dataset prodotto dalle vostre risposte al seguente sondaggio ⬅️ compila il sondaggio e non mancare! 🙋‍♀️<\/p> <p>COMPILA IL SONDAGGIO: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/TTwTECZqfW9Af5nz8\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/TTwTECZqfW9Af5nz8<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Following up our earlier meetup about drake, we have its creator talking about its successor, targets.<\/p> <p>Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>This meetup is the kickoff to the second 2020 R week with The R Conference for Government &amp; Public Sector on December 2-4. Much like our recent NYR, this is virtual, so anyone around the world can attend. Visit <a href=\"https://rstats.ai/gov/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstats.ai/gov/<\/a> to learn more and use code nyhackr for a 20% discount on tickets, including workshops.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Ambitious workflows in R, such as machine learning analyses, can be difficult to manage. A single round of computation can take several hours to complete, and routine updates to the code and data tend to invalidate hard-earned results. You can enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of such projects with the targets R package. targets resolves the dependency structure of your analysis pipeline, skips tasks that are already up to date, executes the rest with optional distributed computing, and manages data storage for you. It surpasses the permanent limitations of its predecessor, drake, and provides increased efficiency and a smoother user experience. This talk demonstrates how to create and maintain a Bayesian model validation project using targets-powered automation.<\/p> <p>About Will:<br/>Will is a statistician and software developer. He likes to solve scientific problems and engage with data analysis technologies.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EST and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

As a relatively new career, it is ambiguously defined, and the job description of a data scientist can vary greatly from company to company. For those reasons, Data Science has attracted both new grads and career changers from all sorts of different fields. For Statisticians, Data Science is an exciting opportunity to apply your hard-earned skills to a variety of interesting and challenging problems. Having a solid Statistics background will give you a head start in that direction. However, Data Science is much more than pure Statistics knowledge. Being able to recognize and take advantage of a team with a diverse set of experiences will provide you with a unique opportunity to grow individually while benefiting your entire team. In this talk, I will walk you through my career journey, the different roles a Data Scientist can take, useful skills for a successful career, and lessons learned.<\/p> <p>~ Bio ~<br/>Gabriela de Queiroz is a Sr. Engineering &amp; Data Science Manager at IBM where she manages and leads a team of developers working on Data &amp; AI Open Source projects.<br/>She works to democratize AI by building tools and launching new open source projects. She is passionate about making data science available to everybody and is actively involved with several organizations to foster an inclusive community.<br/>She is the founder of AI Inclusive (ai-inclusive.org), a global organization that is helping increase the representation and participation of gender minorities in Artificial Intelligence. She is also the founder of R-Ladies (rladies.org), a worldwide organization for promoting diversity in the R community with more than 180 chapters in 50+ countries.<br/>She has worked in several startups and where she built teams, developed statistical models, and employed a variety of techniques to derive insights and drive data-centric decisions.<br/>She likes to mentor and shares her knowledge through mentorship programs, tutorials, and talks.<\/p> ",

She enjoys developing machine learning methods for analyses of biomedical data, including neuroimage (functional/structural MRI), transcriptomics and genotypes. Most of the datasets she works with are high dimensional (i.e., have many predictors/features), so she spends most of her time building feature selection algorithms for these data. She trades her bias toward the nearest-neighbor concept for lower variance of her methods and better generalizability. When she is not knee deep in data, she runs, dance and seasonally skis.<\/p> ",

She has collaborated with medical and surgical oncologists in the design and analysis of large-scale Phase III cancer clinical trials, using survival and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. She has also worked closely with radiation biologists in developing and implementing innovative dose response designs for Phase I and II studies to evaluate dose escalation of radiation therapy, with immunologists developing designs for Phase II studies to evaluate combination therapy with biologic agents, and has used robust regression and data visualization tools in S-Plus and R to visualize dose response surfaces for combination antifungal drug therapy in murine models and in vitro drug susceptibility testing. Now retired, Dr. Madeline Bauer helps high school students with their science projects, mentors undergraduate statistics and data science students preparing for ASA DataFest, and serves as a co-organizer for R-Ladies Irvine.<\/p> <p>Abstract: The general purpose of developing a regression model is to understand the association between a response Y and X and/or to predict Y given X, where X is a set of independent variables. In this talk, we give an overview of regression and highlight some of the regression packages available in R. We start with examples of suggested best workflow practices that are useful regardless of the specific regression model. For model-specific workflows, we take advantage of the \"methods\" associated with the model, such as \"summary\", \"print\", and especially \"plot.\" These methods illustrate the individual package author’s approaches to check the model assumptions, estimate the association between the response and the covariates and evaluate the fit and accuracy of the resulting model. We will demonstrate these methods with real datasets. The data and R code will be available to download.<\/p> <p># A Study of Medical Treatments for COVID-19<br/>Speaker: Song Zhai<\/p> <p>Bio: Song Zhai is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at UC, Riverside. After finishing his master degree in the Department of Mathematics at Texas A&amp;M University, Song Zhai joined UCR in Fall 2016, under the supervision of Dr. Xinping Cui. Song’s previous projects include a retrospective study for biomarker selection with Parkside Medical Group; efficient polygenic risk score developing at Merck; and best predictive biomarker identification with Xinping. Song’s research focus is on pharmacogenomics, with an emphasis on applications rooted in biomarker study, multiple testing, and causal inference.<\/p> <p>Abstract: To the end of this study, various medical treatments for COVID-19 are attempted. A total of 417 patients were considered and 414 of them were included in this study (3 deaths) with mild-to-critical COVID-19. Patients were followed up for recurrence for 28 days quarantine after being discharged. We applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to overcome the rare recurring events in certain patient subgroups. Virtual Twins Matching (VTM) analysis, facilitated by random forest regression, was performed for medical treatment-recurrence classification, while minimizing effects of confounding factors. We used the Multiple Comparisons with the Best (MCB) as the test of the best drug combination in each patient subgroup. The insights into combinatorial therapy found in this study shed light on the use of a combination of (biological and chemical) anti-virus therapy and/or anti-cytokine storm as a potentially effective therapeutic treatment for COVID-19.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.<\/p> <p>Celebrated feminist advocate Caroline Criado Perez investigates the shocking root cause of gender inequality and research in Invisible Women​, diving into women’s lives at home, the workplace, the public square, the doctor’s office, and more. Built on hundreds of studies in the US, the UK, and around the world, and written with energy, wit, and sparkling intelligence, this is a groundbreaking, unforgettable exposé that will change the way you look at the world.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

Furthermore, Sentinel-2 sensors, including 13 spectral bands in the visible and infrared wavelengths, provide very valuable information which can be used to automatically perform tasks such as classify crop types, assess forest changes, or monitor build-up area development. This is particularly important now, in the era of rapid changes in the environment related to climate change. In R, there are plenty of tools and packages which can be used for satellite images such as pre-processing, analyzing, and visualizing data in a simple and efficient way. Also, the variety of methods, such as machine learning algorithms, are available in R and can be applied in the analysis of satellite imagery. I would like to show the framework for acquiring, pre-processing and preliminary analysis of the Sentinel-2 time series in R. It includes the spectral indices calculation, the use of the machine learning algorithms in the classification of land cover, and, the analysis of time series of imagery, i.e. determining the changes in environment based on the spectral trajectories of pixels.<\/p> <p>Biography:<br/>Ewa is a Ph.D. candidate in geography at the Jagiellonian University, and a research assistant at the Faculty of Forestry, the University of Agriculture in Kraków. In her research, she focus on the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in determining different forest characteristics, such as tree species composition or detection of forest disturbances. She is also a big R enthusiast and she mostly use it in my analysis!<\/p> ",

She will introduce the topic of Isolation Forests for tree-based anomaly detection.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Branching Out into Isolation Forests: Tree Based Anomaly Detection<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Isolation forests offer a new way to approach unsupervised anomaly detection problems, and in this talk attendees will get an end-to-end tutorial with code and visual explanations on how to apply the technique in R. Among other advantages, isolation forests offer interpretability and rapid runtime, so they are useful in business and production settings.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Stephanie Kirmer is a Senior Data Scientist at Saturn Cloud, a platform enabling easy to use parallelization and scaling for Python with Dask. (But she still loves R as well.) Previously she worked as a DS Tech Lead at Journera, a travel data startup, and Senior Data Scientist at Uptake, where she developed predictive models for diagnosing and preventing mechanical failure. Before joining Uptake, she worked on data science for social policy research at the University of Chicago and taught sociology and health policy at DePaul University.<\/p> <p>Slides/Code:<br/>Stephanie's slides were prepared using the R xaringan package and are available in the following github repository in the 'r' subdirectory. Code used in her demo are also provided in the repo. You are invited to follow along during the presentation. <a href=\"https://github.com/skirmer/isolation_forests\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/skirmer/isolation_forests<\/a><\/p> <p>Twitter: @data_stephanie<\/p> <p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.stephaniekirmer.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.stephaniekirmer.com/<\/a><\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.
