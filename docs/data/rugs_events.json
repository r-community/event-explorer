The [tidymodels](<a href=\"https://www.tidymodels.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tidymodels.org/<\/a>) collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, we'll focus on three specific reasons to consider using tidymodels. We will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: Julia Silge<br/>Julia is a data scientist and software engineer at [RStudio PBC](<a href=\"https://rstudio.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.com/<\/a>) where she works on open source modeling tools. She is both an international keynote speaker and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice, and is the author of [Text Mining with R](<a href=\"https://www.tidytextmining.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tidytextmining.com/<\/a>) with her coauthor David Robinson.

Recent years brought a great turnover in terms of using Shiny in production, thanks to the advances of tools like RStudio Connect. That makes Shiny a perfect choice for both scientific and business applications.<\/p> <p>In this tutorial, I will walk you through the basics of Shiny apps development. We will create our first functional interactive data dashboard, we will learn about good development practices, deployment to shinyapps.io and alternative UI components (shiny.semantic).<\/p> <p>This workshop will assume a basic knowledge of R, (particularly tidyverse and ggplot) and HTML. Workshop materials are courtesy of Appsilon.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Dominik Krzemiński - computational neuroscience PhD student working at the Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre. He works as well for the Appsilon Data Science as an Open Source Tech Lead. Long-time member of Cardiff R User Group. Dominik is interested in neuroscience and machine-learning, particularly decision making.

He obtained his PhD in bioinformatics from the Center for Biological Sequences Analysis at DTU in 2014 after which he held two postdoctoral positions in clinical genetics. Hereafter, he returned to the newly formed Department of Health Technology to continue his research in the Immunoinformatics and Machine Learning Group at section for bioinformatics. Throughout his career, his research focus has been on connecting genotype to phenotype in an immunological context.<\/p> <p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Understanding what constitutes an immune target is pivotal in vaccinology. With the advent of COVID-19 this has only become more evident. While computer-based predictions cannot replace traditional experimental validation in the laboratory, it can serve as an important tool to drastically reduce the target search space and increase understanding. In this webinar, I will demonstrate how we can model immune targets using artificial neural networks (ANNs) in R. ANNs constitute the basic building block of Deep Learning. Moreover, I will use the binding of peptides to the Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHCI) as a study case. pMHC formation is a precursor for activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, which in turn is the primary system for ridding the body of viral infections. The webinar assumes no prior knowledge and will be followed by a Q&amp;A.<\/p> ",

The consumer product landscape, particularly among e-commerce firms, includes a bevy of subscription-based business models. Internet and mobile phone subscriptions are now commonplace and joining the ranks are dietary supplements, meals, clothing, cosmetics and personal grooming products.<\/p> <p>Standard metrics to diagnose a healthy consumer-brand relationship typically include customer purchase frequency and ultimately, retention of the customer demonstrated by regular purchases. If a brand notices that a customer isn’t purchasing, it may consider targeting the customer with discount offers or deploying a tailored messaging campaign in the hope that the customer will return and not “churn”.<\/p> <p>The churn diagnosis, however, becomes more complicated for subscription-based products, many of which offer multiple delivery frequencies and the ability to pause a subscription. Brands with subscription-based products need to have some reliable measure of churn propensity so they can further isolate the factors that lead to churn and preemptively identify at-risk customers.<\/p> <p>During the presentation I’ll show how to analyze churn propensity for products with multiple states, such as different subscription cadences or a paused subscription. If the time allows I’ll also present useful plots that provide deep insights during such modeling, that we have developed at Gradient Metrics - a quantitative marketing agency<\/p> ",

These powerful function approximators typically require large amounts of data to be trained, which poses a challenge in the usual case where little labeled data is available. During the last year, multiple solutions have been proposed to leverage this problem, based on the concept of self-supervised learning, which can be understood as a specific case of unsupervised learning. This talk will cover its basic principles and provide examples in the field of multimedia.<\/p> <p>ABOUT SPEAKER<br/>Be ready for a long and interesting list of experiences, titles, and recognitions that our guest Xavier has.<\/p> <p>Xavier Giro-i-Nieto is an associate professor at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona as a member of the Intelligent Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research Center (IDEAI-UPC) and Image Processing Group (GPI), and also a visiting researcher at Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). He graduated in Telecommunications Engineering at ETSETB (UPC) in 2000, after completing his master thesis on image compression at the Vrije Universiteit in Brussels (VUB) with Prof. Peter Schelkens. After working one year in Sony Brussels, he started a Ph.D. on computer vision, supervised by Prof. Ferran Marqués. In parallel, he designed and taught courses at the ESEIAAT (video content delivery) and ETSETB (deep learning) schools at UPC, as well as the Master in Computer Vision of Barcelona (video analysis).

    "description": "<p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0r3VYZ0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0r3VYZ0<\/a><\/p> <p>Spark OCR is an object character recognition library that can scale natively on any Spark cluster; enables processing documents privately without uploading them to a cloud service; and most importantly, provides state-of-the-art accuracy for a variety of common use cases. A primary method of maximizing accuracy is using a set of pre-built image pre-processing transformers - for noise reduction, skew correction, object removal, automated scaling, erosion, binarization, and dilation. These transformers can be combined into OCR pipelines that effectively resolve common 'document noise' issues that reduce OCR accuracy.<\/p> <p>This webinar describes real-world OCR use cases, common accuracy issues they bring, and how to use image transformers in Spark OCR in order to resolve them at scale. Example Python code will be shared using executable notebooks that will be made publicly available.<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0r3VYZ0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0r3VYZ0<\/a><\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>About the speaker<br/>Mykola Melnyk is a senior Scala, Python, and Spark software engineer with 15 years of industry experience.

    "description": "<p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0shHhB0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0shHhB0<\/a><\/p> <p>Artificial intelligence projects in high-compliance industries, like healthcare and life science, often require processing Protected Health Information (PHI). This may happen because the nature of the projects does not allow full de-identification in advance – for example, when dealing with rare diseases, genetic sequencing data, identify theft, or training de-identification models – or when training is anonymized data but inference must happen on data with PHI.<\/p> <p>In such scenarios, the alternative is to create an “AI cleanroom” – an isolated, hardened, air-gap environment where the work happens. Such a software platform should enable data scientists to log into the cleanroom, and do all the development work inside it – from initial data exploration &amp; experimentation to model deployment &amp; operations – while no data, computation, or generated assets ever leave the cleanroom.<\/p> <p>This webinar presents the architecture of such a Cleanroom AI Platform, which has been actively used by Fortune 500 companies for the past three years. Second, it will survey the hundreds of DevOps &amp; SecOps features requires to realize such a platform – from multi-factor authentication and point-to-point encryption to vulnerability scanning and network isolation. Third, it will explain how a Kubernetes-based architecture enables “Cleanroom AI” without giving up on the main benefits of cloud computing: elasticity, scalability, turnkey deployment, and a fully managed environment.<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0shHhB0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0shHhB0<\/a><\/p> ",

You're not alone! Fortunately, there are simple practices that you can use to help you develop more reproducible R code. In this tutorial, you will 1) explore some of the common causes of non-reproducible code, 2) gain practical experience fixing reproducibility issues, and 3) use the R package workflowr (<a href=\"https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/<\/a>) to facilitate creation of more reproducible and shareable code. The tutorial will be hands-on and interactive, with small-group exercises.<\/p> <p>Prerequisites:<br/>Participants should have some experience using R (e.g. importing data from a file, loading a package). The tutorial will involve running R code in R Markdown files from the RStudio IDE. If you are unfamiliar with R Markdown, we recommend reviewing these short guides before participating in the tutorial:<br/>[Introduction](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html<\/a>),<br/>[How It Works](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html<\/a>),<br/>[Code Chunks](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html<\/a>].<\/p> <p>*Requirements:*<br/>A web browser, an account on GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/<\/a>), and an account on RStudio Cloud (<a href=\"https://rstudio.cloud/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.cloud/<\/a>). We will email you the tutorial materials.<\/p> <p>Instructors:<br/>Dr. John Blischak received his PhD in Genetics from the University of Chicago. He is the author of the CRAN package workflowr, and has years of experience performing reproducible data analysis with R, R Markdown, and Git. He is a certified Software Carpentry Instructor, and has taught over 10 workshops for researchers covering topics such as Bash, Python, R, and Git. He co-authored the tutorial published in PLoS Computational Biology, A quick introduction to version control with Git and GitHub. Lastly, he has taught the workflowr framework in a live workshop setting four times.<\/p> <p>Dr. Peter Carbonetto, a co-author of the workflowr R package, is a research staff scientist in the Human Genetics Department and the cross-disciplinary Research Computing Center at the University of Chicago.

    "title": "R-Ladies Santiago: useR! 2020 Tutorial: Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp",
    "group": "R-Ladies Santiago",
    "start": "2020-07-14",
    "description": "<p>The RLadies chapters and the R User Group from Chile are very happy to announce that we will be hosting one of the useR! 2020 online tutorials (<a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/<\/a>). We will have the honor of having Dirk Eddelbuettel in our meetup, who will be running the tutorial: \"Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp\" on July 14th, 15:00 UTC.<\/p> <p>- Background<\/p> <p>R has risen to become the lingua franca of statistical research and applications. At the same time, user demands on computing resources and performance have also increased. This is driven chiefly by the ever-growing size of datasets, and may sometimes be coupled with increases in their complexity. The quest for computing with larger datasets, as well as the ever-present desire to also compute \"faster\" make complementing the interpreted language-processing at the core of R with native code extensions a natural next step. The Rcpp package has become the principal venue for extending R with compiled code. It makes it easy to extend R with C or C++ spanning the range from simple one-liners to larger routines and bindings of entire external libraries.<\/p> <p>- Workshop contents<\/p> <p>We will motivate and introduce Rcpp as a natural extension to R that provides an easy-to-use and powerful interface. Helper functions and tools including RStudio will be used to easy creation of R extensions. Several examples will introduce basic use cases including writing code with RcppArmadillo which is the most widely-used package on top of Rcpp.<\/p> <p>- Target Audience<\/p> <p>R users wanting to go beyond R.

    "description": "<p>Marketers often use A/B testing as a tool to compare marketing treatments in a test stage and then deploy the better-performing treatment to the remainder of the consumer population. These tests have traditionally been analyzed using hypothesis testing, which Elea covered in a previous R Ladies workshop. In this workshop, Elea and Ron will explain a new approach to A/B testing that they developed called \"Test &amp; Roll\" that focuses on the profit earned during and after the test. It is based on a Bayesian decision theory and the (very technical) Test &amp; Roll paper explains why marketers should use this approach. This workshop will focus on how to Test &amp; Roll using hands-on examples in R. Elea and Ron will cover:<\/p> <p>- When you should use \"Test &amp; Roll\" versus traditional hypothesis test<br/>- How to compute the Test &amp; Roll sample size that maximizes profits<br/>- How to estimate priors from your own data to help plan your Test &amp; Roll<br/>- How to analyze a Test &amp; Roll experiment (It's easy!)<\/p> <p>All you need to participate are basic R skills; we'll explain the rest. All code and data will be available via Github. Participants should install R, the rstan package and RStudio prior to the workshop.<\/p> <p>Speakers:<br/>- Elea McDonnell Feit is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the LeBow College of Business at Drexel University. She develops data analysis methods to inform marketing decisions including designing new products as well as planning advertising campaigns.<\/p> <p>- Ron Berman is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania.

    "description": "<p>What a treat!<\/p> <p>An event with our beloved xaringan ninja- Dr Emi Tanaka! This event is co-organised with R-Ladies Canberra, SSA Canberra &amp; SSA NSW and promises to be full of tips and tricks for how to make impressive RMarkdown-based presentations using xaringan.<\/p> <p>Abstract: In many fields, scientific communications and publications are unimaginable without LaTeX. LaTeX, built on the TeX typesetting program, allows writing scientific documents with a markup language for structure and styling; capabilities for mathematical typesetting; ability to add cross-references and citations (though BibTeX or otherwise); and customisation through document classes, packages and macros. A particular LaTeX document class widely used for making presentation slides is Beamer. Beamer offers much of the same features as the original LaTeX in addition to special macros handy for presentation purposes and is used often by academics presenting mathematical content. Why then would we want another tool for presentation?<\/p> <p>In this tutorial talk, I will talk about the capabilities and benefits of using R Markdown to make presentation slides based on the `xaringan` R-package. If you have two monitors or an extra laptop/desktop computer, then you are encouraged to try some coding yourself as you follow along with the talk.<\/p> <p>Coding requirements: you will need to be familiar with R, have R and the xaringan &amp; tidyverse R packages installed. It is preferable that you use RStudio IDE although not required.<\/p> <p>Biography: Emi is an applied statistician whose primary interest is to develop impactful methods and tools that can be readily used by practitioners. Her research interests include mixed models and experimental designs, motivated primarily by the problems in bioinformatics and agricultural sciences. She recently joined as a lecturer at the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, Monash University. She is currently the Vice President of the Statistical Society of Australia Victoria Branch.<\/p> <p>Register in advance for this meeting:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://anu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYqcu6pqj0vG9I4fvMeFOo0OuA0URBAsSdY\" class=\"linkified\">https://anu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYqcu6pqj0vG9I4fvMeFOo0OuA0URBAsSdY<\/a><\/p> <p>After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.<\/p> <p>Any questions, please feel free to contact [masked] or [masked]<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>The RLadies chapters and the R User Group from Chile are very happy to announce that we will be hosting one of the useR! 2020 online tutorials (<a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/<\/a>). We will have the honor of having Dirk Eddelbuettel in our meetup, who will be running the tutorial: \"Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp\" on July 14th, 15:00 UTC.<\/p> <p>- Background<\/p> <p>R has risen to become the lingua franca of statistical research and applications. At the same time, user demands on computing resources and performance have also increased. This is driven chiefly by the ever-growing size of datasets, and may sometimes be coupled with increases in their complexity. The quest for computing with larger datasets, as well as the ever-present desire to also compute \"faster\" make complementing the interpreted language-processing at the core of R with native code extensions a natural next step. The Rcpp package has become the principal venue for extending R with compiled code. It makes it easy to extend R with C or C++ spanning the range from simple one-liners to larger routines and bindings of entire external libraries.<\/p> <p>- Workshop contents<\/p> <p>We will motivate and introduce Rcpp as a natural extension to R that provides an easy-to-use and powerful interface. Helper functions and tools including RStudio will be used to easy creation of R extensions. Several examples will introduce basic use cases including writing code with RcppArmadillo which is the most widely-used package on top of Rcpp.<\/p> <p>- Target Audience<\/p> <p>R users wanting to go beyond R. Prior experience with compiled languages like C and C++ is helpful but not required.<\/p> <p>- About the instructor<\/p> <p>Dr Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a (co-)author and maintainer for the Rcpp project since its inception.

    "description": "<p>Hi everyone,<\/p> <p>The R Ladies chapters of the Netherlands are partnering up and are hosting an online book club. As a first book, we chose to read and discuss Hadley Wickham's Advanced R book (<a href=\"https://adv-r.hadley.nz/\" class=\"linkified\">https://adv-r.hadley.nz/<\/a>).<br/>Join us for our next meeting, in which Semiramis Castro will present the key points of Chapter 8: \"Conditions\". After that, we'll try some exercises together and help each other clear up any doubts and get over any hurdles :)<\/p> <p>You can find the full schedule and more information here: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladiesnl/book_club\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladiesnl/book_club<\/a><\/p> <p>And sign up to discuss one of the chapters at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2QBYGEG\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/2QBYGEG<\/a>!<\/p> <p>ABOUT Semiramis<br/>----------------------<br/>Semiramis is a software developer/data scientist who codes mainly in R and Python. She's a recent PhD graduate from the National Autonomous University of Mexico with a focus on genomics of pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance. Among the bacteria she studied are the emerging pathogen Acinetobacter haemolyticus and the deadly Acinetobacter baumannii.<\/p> <p>ABOUT the chapter<br/>----------------------<br/>“Conditions” is the umbrella term used to describe errors, warnings, and messages. You’ve certainly encountered these before, so in this chapter you learn how to signal them appropriately in your own functions, and how to handle them when signalled elsewhere.<\/p> <p>REQUIREMENTS<br/>----------------------<br/>Make sure to read the chapter in advance!<br/>Note that Jitsi works best with chrome<\/p> <p>LINK TO MEETUP<br/>----------------------<br/><a href=\"https://meet.jit.si/rladiesnl_bookclub_chp8\" class=\"linkified\">https://meet.jit.si/rladiesnl_bookclub_chp8<\/a><\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct.

Let's use datasets that aren't connected with racists. This talk will offer alternatives, as well as highlighting lots of places to search when you need data for your projects, training and exploration.<\/p> <p>Jyoti Bhogal, \"Exploring R Package: janitor\"<br/>Most data projects usually begin with cleaning the data. It can take a lot of efforts, which can otherwise be useful while the acutual analysis. 'janitor' does exactly that when combined with 'here' and 'lintr'.<br/>Let's explore this further!<\/p> <p>Fiona Tweedie: \"Flexdashboards for understanding communities\"<br/>This talk would introduce the use of Rmarkdown and flexdashboards to make official statistics such as Census or Deprivation data accessible to communities in a visual way. Particularly relevant with Census 2021 in the UK, and other countries, as well as Deprivation statistics just having been released in UK nations.<\/p> ",

Using the examples of fairy tales, like the Grimm brothers collection and Alice in Wonderland, we will prepare and tokenize text data, extract the most frequent words, and display these results graphically. Then, we will explore methods for comparing more than one text source, finding words that are especially characteristic of a particular author/speaker/genre/chapter and comparing these to similar texts. After this meetup, you'll know how to compute word frequencies, identify unique word choices, calculate text-level measures such as lexical density, and create exciting visualizations of text statistics in R.<\/p> <p>R-users of all levels can get something out of this Meetup, as we will walk you through every step from reading in data to tuning the graphical parameters.

Es requisito para asistir estar de acuerdo con él: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki/Code-of-Conduct#spanish<\/a><\/p> <p>Lo segundo, es haber instalado ya Git en tu computador (<a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://git-scm.com/<\/a>) y tener una cuenta en GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/<\/a>). Es importante que estés segura que puedes utilizar Git desde RStudio. Si te resultaron las actividades de la sesión 3, entonces tienes todo lo necesario :)<\/p> <p>Lo tercero, es asegurarte que puedes utilizar la aplicación Zoom en tu computador. El día del taller te enviaremos el enlace para unirte (chequea ese día que el mensaje no se haya ido a la carpeta de spam). Usualmente compartimos el enlace 30 minutos antes de la sesión.<\/p> <p>- ¿Qué pasa si no leo en inglés?<br/>¡Puedes participar igual! La persona encargada de cada sesión hará una síntesis de los puntos más importantes, así que incluso si no puedes revisar el libro, podrás aprender sobre este tema :)<\/p> <p>- Estoy recién aprendiendo sobre R, ¿puedo participar?<br/>Sí. Si bien el foco de estas sesiones no es programar en R, sí es importante estar familiarizada con RStudio como entorno de trabajo. Si quieres, puedes revisar los vídeos de nuestro taller introductorio: <a href=\"https://github.com/rladieschile/taller-introductorio-mayo\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/rladieschile/taller-introductorio-mayo<\/a>.<\/p> ",

    "title": "R-Ladies Valparaíso: useR! 2020 Tutorial: Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp",
    "group": "R-Ladies Valparaíso",
    "start": "2020-07-14",
    "description": "<p>The RLadies chapters and the R User Group from Chile are very happy to announce that we will be hosting one of the useR! 2020 online tutorials (<a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/<\/a>). We will have the honor of having Dirk Eddelbuettel in our meetup, who will be running the tutorial: \"Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp\" on July 14th, 15:00 UTC.<\/p> <p>- Background<\/p> <p>R has risen to become the lingua franca of statistical research and applications. At the same time, user demands on computing resources and performance have also increased. This is driven chiefly by the ever-growing size of datasets, and may sometimes be coupled with increases in their complexity. The quest for computing with larger datasets, as well as the ever-present desire to also compute \"faster\" make complementing the interpreted language-processing at the core of R with native code extensions a natural next step. The Rcpp package has become the principal venue for extending R with compiled code. It makes it easy to extend R with C or C++ spanning the range from simple one-liners to larger routines and bindings of entire external libraries.<\/p> <p>- Workshop contents<\/p> <p>We will motivate and introduce Rcpp as a natural extension to R that provides an easy-to-use and powerful interface. Helper functions and tools including RStudio will be used to easy creation of R extensions. Several examples will introduce basic use cases including writing code with RcppArmadillo which is the most widely-used package on top of Rcpp.<\/p> <p>- Target Audience<\/p> <p>R users wanting to go beyond R. Prior experience with compiled languages like C and C++ is helpful but not required.<\/p> <p>- About the instructor<\/p> <p>Dr Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a (co-)author and maintainer for the Rcpp project since its inception. He works as a senior \"quant\" in industry combining C++ and R for high-frequency data analysis and predictive models in finance, and teaches a class on Data Science Programming Methods as a Clinical Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is author, co-author, or maintainer of sixty CRAN packages, an elected board member of the R Foundation, and a 25+ year contributor to Debian looking after 150+ packages including R.<\/p> <p>- Attending the workshop<\/p> <p>Please, read carefully the useR! 2020 Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/<\/a>. All participants are required to agree to it.<\/p> <p>The tutorial will start at 15:OO UTC and has a duration of two hours (+ a 10 minutes break). Check your timezone here: <a href=\"https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2020-07-14/15:00/Seamless%20R%20and%20C%2B%2B%20integration%20with%20Rcpp\" class=\"linkified\">https://arewemeetingyet.com/UTC/2020-07-14/15:00/Seamless%20R%20and%20C%2B%2B%20integration%20with%20Rcpp<\/a><\/p> <p>[UPDATED SECTION]<\/p> <p>We'll be hosting the tutorial on Zoom. The link will be shared in the comments of this event half an hour in advanced. The meeting has a waiting room. We'll let everyone in at 15:00 UTC.<\/p> <p>For the tutorial you'll need to install Rcpp from CRAN. You will also need a compiler. Please read sections 1.2 and 1.3 on the second page of the Rcpp FAQ to check specific recommendations for Windows/OSX/Linux users: <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf\" class=\"linkified\">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf<\/a><br/>We'll be using RStudio. Is not a bad idea to have an rstudio.cloud account as back-up.<\/p> ",

Further, this year the conference tutorials will be done in partnership with R-Ladies Global, MiR, and the AfricaR user group.<\/p> <p>The AWESOME news is that our group, R-Ladies San Diego, has been chosen to host one of the UseR! tutorials this year! We are really excited to bring this opportunity to our members and to other R enthusiasts from all over the world!<\/p> <p>The tutorial we are hosting will be presented by disk.frame creator Zhuo Jia Dai (ZJ). He'll tell us more about \"Easy Larger-than-RAM data manipulation with disk.frame\".<\/p> <p>Here's ZJ's description: In this tutorial, we will present the {disk.frame} (diskframe.com) R package for handling datasets that are too large for RAM but still fits comfortably on your hard drive. We will go through how {disk.frame} works, how to manipulate ten's of gigabytes of data without using all your RAM, and how you can take advantage of the many CPU cores on your computer by parallelizing data manipulation task using {disk.frame}. Also, I will show you how to perform all the standard data manipulations by using just dplyr verbs! After the tutorial, you should be able to confidently tackle dataset up to ten's of gigabytes in size comfortably on your laptop.<\/p> <p>I really hope you can all make it to our very first online event. This is such an amazing opportunity for all of us! Hopefully useR! 2020 will allow many that might not have been able to attend such a conference in person to join us in our exploration of the R universe.<\/p> <p>We really look forward to (virtually) seeing everyone again soon!<\/p> <p>Your R-Ladies SD organizers<\/p> ",

You’re not alone! Fortunately, there are simple practices that you can use to help you develop more reproducible R code. In this tutorial, you will 1) explore some of the common causes of non-reproducible code, 2) gain practical experience fixing reproducibility issues, and 3) use the R package workflowr (<a href=\"https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/<\/a>) to facilitate creation of more reproducible and shareable code. The tutorial will be hands-on and interactive, with small-group exercises.<\/p> <p>Prerequisites:<br/>Participants should have some experience using R (e.g. importing data from a file, loading a package). The tutorial will involve running R code in R Markdown files from the RStudio IDE. If you are unfamiliar with R Markdown, we recommend reviewing these short guides before participating in the tutorial: [Introduction](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html<\/a>), [How It Works](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-2.html<\/a>), [Code Chunks](<a href=\"https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html<\/a>].<\/p> <p>Requirements:<br/>A web browser, an account on GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/<\/a>), and an account on RStudio Cloud (<a href=\"https://rstudio.cloud/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.cloud/<\/a>).

    "description": "<p>Emi Tanaka is an applied statistician whose primary interest is to develop impactful methods and tools that can be readily used by practitioners. Her research interests include mixed models and experimental designs, motivated primarily by the problems in bioinformatics and agricultural sciences. She recently joined as a lecturer at the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, Monash University. She is currently the Vice President of the Statistical Society of Australia Victoria Branch.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, Emi takes us \"Beyond Beamer: Modern and Dynamic Presentations with R Markdown\". In many fields, scientific communications and publications are unimaginable without LaTeX. LaTeX, built on the TeX typesetting program, allows writing scientific documents with a markup language for structure and styling; capabilities for mathematical typesetting; ability to add cross-references and citations (though BibTeX or otherwise); and customisation through document classes, packages and macros. A particular LaTeX document class widely used for making presentation slides is Beamer. Beamer offers much of the same features as the original LaTeX in addition to special macros handy for presentation purposes and is used often by academics presenting mathematical content. Why then would we want another tool for presentation?<\/p> <p>In this tutorial talk, Emi will talk about the capabilities and benefits of using R Markdown to make presentation slides based on the `xaringan` R-package. If you have two monitors or an extra laptop/desktop computer, then you are encouraged to try some coding yourself as you follow along with the talk.<\/p> <p>Coding requirements: you will need to be familiar with R, have R and the xaringan &amp; tidyverse R packages installed. It is preferable that you use RStudio IDE although not required.<\/p> ",

But how secure is this process? In this talk, we won't look at complex hacking but instead, focus on the relatively easy hacks that can be performed to access systems. We'll use three R related examples of how it is possible to access a users system. In the first example, we'll investigate domain squatting on the Bioconductor website. By registering only thirteen domains, we had the potential to run arbitrary on hundreds of users. In the second example, we'll look at techniques for guessing passwords on RStudio server instances. Lastly, we'll highlight how users can be a little too trusting when running R code from blogs.<\/p> <p>Bristol R User Group is proudly sponsored by Unai, the R Consortium, and Ovo Energy who are our venue sponsor when we're back to running these in person!<\/p> ",

Erin will discuss the Why's, How's, and Best Practices she's learned over the past few years of leading trainings.<\/p> <p>Bio: Erin works as a Data Scientist at Uncommon Schools where she trains coworkers in R as well as maintaining two R packages. Prior to Uncommon, she worked as a Data Scientist at Crisis Text Line, and a software programmer at NASA while completing her Data Science Masters at Columbia University. Before data science, Erin researched star formation and taught introductory courses in astronomy and physics at the University of Maryland.<\/p> <p>\"flexdashboard for Prototyping and Profit\"<br/>Speaker: Kaelen Medeiros<\/p> <p>Abstract: The flexdashboard package allows you to build Shiny dashboards quickly using a RMarkdown document. This is advantageous in situations where you need to prototype a data product (often a dashboard or interactive report) and need to sell stakeholders on the value of the product built. Kaelen will talk about the basics of using flexdashboard and then give tips on utilizing it to build data product MVPs (minimum viable products) to communicate vision to stakeholders, plus discuss flexdashboard extensions and how to go about converting your flexdash to a Shiny dashboard (if you're ready or even need to!)<\/p> <p>Bio: Kaelen is a data scientist at Medidata Solutions where they work as an R programmer on the microservices team. They've also worked at Spring Health, DataCamp, HERE Technologies, and have done a fair amount of R and Shiny consulting on the side. Kaelen was at various times a film theorist, preschool teacher, test prep tutor, videographer, and nanny before getting a MS in biostatistics from LSU Health Sciences Center in 2016 and starting to work as a statistician and data scientist. They have a cat named Scully and enjoy talking about podcats, aliens, data, and would love to see a photo of your pet if you're sharing.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.

    "group": "R-Ladies Concepción",
    "start": "2020-07-14",
    "description": "<p>The RLadies chapters and the R User Group from Chile are very happy to announce that we will be hosting one of the useR! 2020 online tutorials (<a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/program/tutorials/<\/a>). We will have the honor of having Dirk Eddelbuettel in our meetup, who will be running the tutorial: \"Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp\" on July 14th, 15:00 UTC.<\/p> <p>- Background<\/p> <p>R has risen to become the lingua franca of statistical research and applications. At the same time, user demands on computing resources and performance have also increased. This is driven chiefly by the ever-growing size of datasets, and may sometimes be coupled with increases in their complexity. The quest for computing with larger datasets, as well as the ever-present desire to also compute \"faster\" make complementing the interpreted language-processing at the core of R with native code extensions a natural next step. The Rcpp package has become the principal venue for extending R with compiled code. It makes it easy to extend R with C or C++ spanning the range from simple one-liners to larger routines and bindings of entire external libraries.<\/p> <p>- Workshop contents<\/p> <p>We will motivate and introduce Rcpp as a natural extension to R that provides an easy-to-use and powerful interface. Helper functions and tools including RStudio will be used to easy creation of R extensions. Several examples will introduce basic use cases including writing code with RcppArmadillo which is the most widely-used package on top of Rcpp.<\/p> <p>- Target Audience<\/p> <p>R users wanting to go beyond R. Prior experience with compiled languages like C and C++ is helpful but not required.<\/p> <p>- About the instructor<\/p> <p>Dr Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a (co-)author and maintainer for the Rcpp project since its inception. He works as a senior \"quant\" in industry combining C++ and R for high-frequency data analysis and predictive models in finance, and teaches a class on Data Science Programming Methods as a Clinical Professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is author, co-author, or maintainer of sixty CRAN packages, an elected board member of the R Foundation, and a 25+ year contributor to Debian looking after 150+ packages including R.<\/p> <p>- Attending the workshop<\/p> <p>Please, read carefully the useR! 2020 Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/codeofconduct/<\/a>.

Whilst having much in common with tabular data, this unstructured format has many of its own special quirks and idiosyncrasies. Now, on the precipice of project completion, I reflect on the challenges I faced, how I overcame them, and share the libraries, techniques, and resources that were instrumental in getting me there.<\/p> ",

Here is my proposal:<\/p> <p>- Gather a small group of 2-5 and learn together.<br/>- Meet at a coffee shop, library, or some other space that has Wi-Fi.<br/>- Pick a project, data set or problem, then work to solve it with different tools.<br/>- Keep it fluid and informal.<br/>- Meet on a regular basis, say weekly to start, and adjust as needed.<br/>- Aim to keep the meetings 2-4 hours long, but this can be adjusted to the project or group. People can come and go as needed.<br/>- It does not have to be the same people each time, so you only have to commit to going once to check it out.<\/p> <p>Are you interested? Show up at the meeting spot, have some coffee, meet new friends and bring a project or question.<\/p> ",

In this talk we will learn how to query databases and return the results as an R data frame. We will show how packages like DBI and dbplyr allow us to use dplyr syntax to run queries against a database and return the results. This allows us to keep our workflow entirely within R, instead of switching contexts between SQL and R. After looking at a few examples, we will cover some tips for incorporating these ideas into our daily work as well as resources for moving beyond the basics.<\/p> <p>Talk #2: Asmae Toumi, favorite packages for missing data in R:<\/p> <p>Asmae Toumi will give a very broad overview of how to leverage the {naniar} package to explore and visualize missing data, identify patterns of missing data, and impute missing data using the {MICE} package.<\/p> <p>Talk #3: Amanda Hart, Tips &amp; tricks for making your own R package:<\/p> <p>From plotting to analysis, packages are foundational tools for R users. But what happens when there isn’t an existing package to meet your needs? In this talk, we will learn how to take your own code and turn it into a new R package. We will provide simple steps to get started and tips to add features as you become package-building experts.<\/p> <p>Talk #4: Juliana Capitanio, Flexdashboards: Using interactive dashboards to create data visualizations<\/p> <p>Juliana Capitanio will show us how to use R Markdown to quickly create a dashboard using the flexdashboards package. These dashboards can compile plots, tables, gauges, value boxes, text annotations and maps into various layouts. Dashboard components are responsive and quickly resize to fit mobile devices. Further, we can easily make dashboard elements interactive by using htmlwidgets for R and/or Shiny.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>È tempo di un nuovo sondaggio per #sviluppatori e data scientists!<\/p> <p>Questo non è un evento ma un invito ad aiutarci a raggiungere un obiettivo che ad RLadies Italy ci siamo prefissati con partner di #DeveloperEconomics<\/p> <p>*Quali nuovi skills vorresti migliorare nel 2021? Quali strumenti o piattaforme di sviluppo diventeranno obsolete durante il prossimo anno?*<\/p> <p>Abbiamo deciso di supportare il nuovo questionario Developer Economics survey Q2 2020 per avere delle risposte.<br/>Il questionario è molto chiaro e diretto al sodo. Condividi le tue opinioni su i più popolari strumenti di sviluppo, piattaforme, tecnologie e framework. Cosa ti piace usare? Cosa hai provato ma poi subito abbandonato perché non abbastanza intuitivo, o cosa vorresti conoscere meglio?<\/p> <p>Rispondi a queste domande per aiutarci a scoprire cosa manca sul mercato. Il questionario è aperto solo a sviluppatori e data scientists, ma invita tutti a partecipare: studenti, professionisti, e coloro che si dilettano per hobby. I risultati saranno disponibili in autunno e pubblicati nel nuovo State of the Developer Nation (disponibile gratuitamente per tutti!). Qui avrai grafici e informazioni su trend globali che potrai utilizzare per avere un quadro più amplio e aggiornato del mercato.<\/p> <p>Coloro che si registrano e completano il questionario parteciperanno automaticamente all'estrazione di uno dei premi in palio. Il montepremi ammonta a +15 mila $, e sono inclusi premi tipo iPhone 11, Oculus Quest 64GB, JetBrains All Product Pack, Corsair Mechanical Gaming keyboard, Cloud Guru license, più una serie di gadgets e accessori, e vouchers Amazon. Sei pronto per una sfida? Ci sono altri 1000 $ in cash come premio se spargi la voce e altri sviluppatori partecipano al questionario.<\/p> <p>Un'altra cosa che è veramente importante è che per ogni questionario completato, doneremo $0.10 a Techfugees per supportare e aiutare gli sviluppatori di domani.<\/p> <p>Il questionario è aperto fino al 10 agosto, non perdere quest'occasione!<br/>I risultati del sondaggio sono ciò su cui si basa l'intero ecosistema per creare nuovi strumenti, piattaforme che saranno utilizzate in futuro da voi sviluppatori.<\/p> <p>Fallo per R-Ladies Bari. Se arriviamo ad un numero di risposte valide otterremo dei fondi da investire in un progetto congiunto tra RLadies Bari e RLadies Milano.<\/p> <p>Inizia qui 🚀<br/><a href=\"https://developereconomics.net?member_id=rladies_italy&amp;lang=en\" class=\"linkified\">https://developereconomics.net?member_id=rladies_italy&amp;lang=en<\/a><\/p> ",

    "start": "2020-07-28",
    "description": "<p>Continuing our virtual meetups we have another speaker from far away. This month we have Colin Fay from France.<\/p> <p>Due to COVID-19 the meetup will take place entirely online. Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Our annual R Conference in New York is also virtual-only. We have an excellent lineup including Max Kuhn, Erin LeDell, Rob Hyndman, Jacqueline Nolis and Andrew Gelman. There are also two-days of workshops covering Machine Learning with tidymodels, git, Shiny, web scraping, GIS &amp; Mapping, EDA with the tidyverse and even scikit-learn. Visit <a href=\"https://rstats.ai/nyr/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstats.ai/nyr/<\/a> for more information and use code nyhackr for a 20% discount.<\/p> <p>Since we still can't be together for pizza, Scott's Pizza Tours is sponsoring again and offering everyone 25% off virtual tours booked by July 31. Use code NerdsLovePizza at <a href=\"https://www.scottspizzatours.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.scottspizzatours.com/<\/a> for the discount.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>You've probably already heard that \"Everything not tested will eventually fail\", or read that \"If you're not writing unit tests, your users are the unit tests\"... As extreme as they might sound, these quotes reveal one of the most important things when it comes to production-software: testing should be done as extensively as possible. Most R developers are already familiar with standard package testing, but things can get a little bit different when it comes to interactive web applications: what do we test, why, and how? In this talk, Colin will start by developing the good practices when it comes to testing Shiny, and present some of the tools you can use to test your own applications.<\/p> <p>About Colin:<br/>Colin Fay works at ThinkR, a French agency Focused on everything R-related. During the day, he helps companies to take full advantage of the power of R, by providing training, tools and infrastructure. His main areas of expertise are data &amp; software engineering, back-end &amp; infrastructure, and R in production. During the night, Colin is also a hyperactive open source developer and an open data advocate. You can find a lot of his work on his GitHub account (<a href=\"https://github.com/ColinFay\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/ColinFay<\/a>) and on ThinkR's account (<a href=\"https://github.com/thinkr-open\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/thinkr-open<\/a>). He is also active in the Data Science community in France, and an international speaker.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>La realización de conferencias y meetups sobre R en modalidad virtual es una excelente oportunidad para que grupos menos representados en nuestra comunidad participen en estas instancias. Para muchas personas, la imposibilidad de viajar --sea por la razón que sea-- ha sido un impedimento para poder ser parte de estas actividades. Ahora tenemos una oportunidad que es importante que aprovochemos. Pero ¿cómo preparar una propuesta? ¿Qué debiese incluir el abstract? ¿Para qué conferencia es más apropiada la idea que tengo? ¿Qué debería tener en cuenta al pensar una propuesta de presentación para un meetup? ¿Es lo mismo escribir un abstract para una conferencia de R que para una conferencia en mi disciplina? ¿Qué tengo que incluir en la Bio? Para responder estas preguntas y compartir algunas recomendaciones para diseñar tu propuesta nos juntaremos el próximo sábado 1 de agosto :)<\/p> <p>- ¿Y si todavía no tengo una idea para una presentación?<\/p> <p>No importa. Durante la sesión hablaremos también sobre cómo generar ideas. Además, para el caso de algunas conferencias hay tiempo todavía. Quizás ahora mismo no se te ocurre nada en particular, pero puedes empezar a planear un proyecto para presentar en alguno de los eventos del próximo año.<\/p> <p>- ¿Qué necesito para participar?<\/p> <p>Lo primero, es leer nuestro código de conducta.

The drake R package resolves the dependency structure of data analysis pipelines, skips tasks that are already up to date, and cleanly organizes the output. Workflows with drake are efficient to maintain, and they provide tangible evidence that the results are synchronized with the underlying code and data, which increases one’s ability to trust the conclusions of the research.<\/p> <p>Learning objectives:<br/>1. Function-oriented programming: participants will learn to express data analysis tasks as user-defined<br/>functions, experience the advantages of functions relative to imperative scripts, and understand the role<br/>of functions in drake-powered projects.<br/>2. Declarative workflows: students will declare targets to represent data analysis artifacts, identify the<br/>dependencies of those targets, and inspect the emergent dependency structures of entire workflows.<br/>3. Project maintenance: students will experience drake’s responses to changing code and data, and they<br/>will understand the conditions that allow drake to skip computation and save time.<br/>4. Large plans: participants will practice declaring large collections of targets compactly using drake’s<br/>domain-specific language.<\/p> <p>Computing requirements:<br/>Each participant must have a laptop with a web browser and the ability to connect to the internet.

Para muchas personas, la imposibilidad de viajar --sea por la razón que sea-- ha sido un impedimento para poder ser parte de estas actividades. Ahora tenemos una oportunidad que es importante que aprovochemos. Pero ¿cómo preparar una propuesta? ¿Qué debiese incluir el abstract? ¿Para qué conferencia es más apropiada la idea que tengo? ¿Qué debería tener en cuenta al pensar una propuesta de presentación para un meetup? ¿Es lo mismo escribir un abstract para una conferencia de R que para una conferencia en mi disciplina? ¿Qué tengo que incluir en la Bio? Para responder estas preguntas y compartir algunas recomendaciones para diseñar tu propuesta nos juntaremos el próximo sábado 1 de agosto :)<\/p> <p>- ¿Y si todavía no tengo una idea para una presentación?<\/p> <p>No importa. Durante la sesión hablaremos también sobre cómo generar ideas. Además, para el caso de algunas conferencias hay tiempo todavía. Quizás ahora mismo no se te ocurre nada en particular, pero puedes empezar a planear un proyecto para presentar en alguno de los eventos del próximo año.<\/p> <p>- ¿Qué necesito para participar?<\/p> <p>Lo primero, es leer nuestro código de conducta.

También habrá materiales de apoyo y código en GitHub para que puedas trabajar después.<\/p> <p>El tutorial está pensando para personas con familiaridad intermedia con R, RStudio, conceptos básicos de modelos de regresión y clasificación y paquetes de tidyverse como dplyr y ggplot2.<\/p> <p>Como en todos los eventos de R-Ladies, las personas que participan deben aceptar nuestro Código de Conducta. Para este evento, además adoptamos el Código de Conducta de useR! 2020.<\/p> <p>****** IMPORTANTE ******<br/>Para participar y acceder al link de Zoom que publicaremos media hora antes del evento es necesario que hagas click en el botón \"ASISTIRÉ\".<\/p> <p>- English versión<\/p> <p>This useR! 2020 online tutorial is coming Friday, July 24, 2020 at 14:00 UTC The R-Ladies chapters from Argentina are happy to announce that Emil Hvitfeldt and Julia Silge will be joining us to run their tutorial \"Predictive modeling with text using tidy data principles\".<\/p> <p>Have you ever encountered text data and suspected there was useful insight latent within it but felt frustrated about how to find that insight?<br/>Are you familiar with the basics of predictive modeling, and ready to learn how unstructured text data can be used for prediction within the tidyverse and tidymodels ecosystems?<br/>Do you need a flexible framework for handling text data that empowers you to build supervised predictive models?<br/>Text data is increasingly important in many domains, and tidy modeling principles can be applied to natural language processing tasks. This presentation is designed to provide practical guidance and directly applicable knowledge for data scientists and analysts who want to integrate text into their modeling pipelines.<\/p> <p>In this 90-minute tutorial, learn how to preprocess text data for modeling, train models, and evaluate model performance. We will use slides and live coding during the tutorial to walk through a realistic case study. The tutorial will be streamed, recorded, and captioned, and there will be supporting materials and code on GitHub for you to work through afterward.<\/p> <p>The tutorial is intended for people with intermediate familiarity with R, RStudio, basics of regression and classification modeling, and tidyverse packages such as dplyr and ggplot2.<\/p> <p>As every R-Ladies event, all participants are required to agree to the Code of Conduct. In addition, we also adopt the useR! 2020 Code of Conduct.<\/p> <p>****** NOTICE ******<br/>To participate and accesses to the Zoom link that will be published 30 minutes before the meetup, you have to click on the ATTEND button.<\/p> ",

And then she meets Bill Clinton. A handsome, charismatic southerner and fellow law student, Bill is already planning his political career. In each other, the two find a profound intellectual, emotional, and physical connection that neither has previously experienced.<\/p> <p>In the real world, Hillary followed Bill back to Arkansas, and he proposed several times; although she said no more than once, as we all know, she eventually accepted and became Hillary Clinton.<\/p> <p>But in Curtis Sittenfeld's powerfully imagined tour-de-force of fiction, Hillary takes a different road. Feeling doubt about the prospective marriage, she endures their devastating breakup and leaves Arkansas. Over the next four decades, she blazes her own trail--one that unfolds in public as well as in private, that involves crossing paths again (and again) with Bill Clinton, that raises questions about the tradeoffs all of us must make in building a life.<\/p> <p>Brilliantly weaving a riveting fictional tale into actual historical events, Curtis Sittenfeld delivers an uncannily astute and witty story for our times. In exploring the loneliness, moral ambivalence, and iron determination that characterize the quest for political power, as well as both the exhilaration and painful compromises demanded of female ambition in a world still run mostly by men, Rodham is a singular and unforgettable novel.<br/>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Abstract:<br/>I explore a theory of goal maintenance which states that individuals who achieve significant goals – such as getting out of debt, becoming sober, or losing a substantial amount of weight – are more likely to maintain the progress achieved if they frequently think about the person they were in the past, before meeting the goal, and make downward comparisons between their present self and their past, pre-goal self. In this talk, I will discuss two studies used to test this theory for weight loss maintenance, including an observational study using data from Reddit and a randomized controlled experiment using an Amazon Mechanical Turk population. I will also discuss R methods used to parse through semi-structured data, perform regression analyses and hypothesis tests, and visualize results.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Elicia John is a Behavioral Data Scientist.

Using tracking data, each route can be described as a sequence of spatial-temporal measurements that varies in length depending on the duration of the play. This data can be conveniently analyzed using nested columns in tidyr and purrr. We demonstrate how model-based curve clustering using Bernstein polynomial basis functions (i.e. Bézier curves) fit using the Expectation Maximization algorithm can cluster route trajectories. Each cluster can then be labelled to obtain route names for each route and create route trees for all receivers. The clusters and routes can be visualized nicely using ggplot and seen developing over time using gganimate.<\/p> <p>R + Tidyverse in Sports - Namita Nandakumar<br/>This talk will use a case study, most likely in hockey, to showcase the many ways in which R and the Tidyverse can be used to analyze sports data as well as the unique priorities and considerations that are involved in applying statistical tools to sports problems.<\/p> ",

We will discuss how, as a community of R users, we can make changes to our group so that R-Ladies members who are Black, Indigenous, and POC will feel supported, included, and enthusiastically welcomed and celebrated. We will also use this event as a forum to educate ourselves about how to be anti-racist data scientists, touching on places where allies can be most effective.<\/p> <p>We will discuss meetup event best practices for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and changes we are working on for R-Ladies Seattle. We'll also lead a discussion about which projects/changes R-Ladies members would like to prioritize. Your input and participation in this event is welcomed and appreciated.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, if you'd like get caught up on DEI initiatives and discussions in the broader R community, I recommend reading and viewing the following:<\/p> <p>* Heather Turner's talk at CelebRation 2020 (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbpkKzz71EY\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbpkKzz71EY<\/a>)<br/>* Introducing MiR: A Community of Underrepresented Minority Users of R (<a href=\"https://medium.com/@doritolay/introducing-mir-a-community-for-underrepresented-users-of-r-7560def7d861\" class=\"linkified\">https://medium.com/@doritolay/introducing-mir-a-community-for-underrepresented-users-of-r-7560def7d861<\/a>)<br/>* Supporting diversity in the R community (upcoming useR talk to be live streamed on July 17th: <a href=\"https://user2020.r-project.org/program/agenda/\" class=\"linkified\">https://user2020.r-project.org/program/agenda/<\/a>)<br/>* Discussion between Heather Turner and Jenny Bryan on how to increase diversity of R Core on the R-Ladies Global Slack (if you are on this slack, see discussions in #events_global, invite link to Slack here: <a href=\"https://rladies-community-slack.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rladies-community-slack.herokuapp.com/<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Please reach out to R-Ladies Seattle co-organizers if you have any questions, concerns, comments, or ideas about this event.

El libro está disponible de manera gratuita en: <a href=\"https://happygitwithr.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://happygitwithr.com/<\/a><\/p> <p>- ¿Qué haremos en esta última sesión?<\/p> <p>Durante la sesión pondremos en práctica algunos flujos de trabajo colaborativo. Veremos cómo distintas personas pueden colaborar en un mismo repositorio, cómo agregar cambios a un pull request abierto por ti o por otra persona, cómo dejar disponible en GitHub archivos en html como presentaciones y libros en línea, etc. Si te interesa, tendrás la oportunidad de practicar todo esto durante la sesión. Revisa más abajo qué paquetes tienes que tener instalados.<\/p> <p>Esta sexta sesión estará liderada por Stephanie Orellana (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sporella\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/sporella<\/a>).

    "description": "<p>La realización de conferencias y meetups sobre R en modalidad virtual es una excelente oportunidad para que grupos menos representados en nuestra comunidad participen en estas instancias. Para muchas personas, la imposibilidad de viajar --sea por la razón que sea-- ha sido un impedimento para poder ser parte de estas actividades. Ahora tenemos una oportunidad que es importante que aprovochemos. Pero ¿cómo preparar una propuesta? ¿Qué debiese incluir el abstract? ¿Para qué conferencia es más apropiada la idea que tengo? ¿Qué debería tener en cuenta al pensar una propuesta de presentación para un meetup? ¿Es lo mismo escribir un abstract para una conferencia de R que para una conferencia en mi disciplina? ¿Qué tengo que incluir en la Bio? Para responder estas preguntas y compartir algunas recomendaciones para diseñar tu propuesta nos juntaremos el próximo sábado 1 de agosto :)<\/p> <p>- ¿Y si todavía no tengo una idea para una presentación?<\/p> <p>No importa. Durante la sesión hablaremos también sobre cómo generar ideas. Además, para el caso de algunas conferencias hay tiempo todavía. Quizás ahora mismo no se te ocurre nada en particular, pero puedes empezar a planear un proyecto para presentar en alguno de los eventos del próximo año.<\/p> <p>- ¿Qué necesito para participar?<\/p> <p>Lo primero, es leer nuestro código de conducta.
