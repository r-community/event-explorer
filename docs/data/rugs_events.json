    "group": "R Users & R-Ladies Warsaw (Spotkania Entuzjastów R)",
    "start": "2021-05-12",
    "description": "<p>Selecting test exercises with an appropriate difficulty level is one of the most important aspects of a high-quality assessment, but how do we know how difficult a given exercise is? <\/p> <p>One of the possible approaches is to use Item Response Theory - a set of psychometric models which can be used to estimate learners’ proficiency and parameters of each exercise. This approach works well in most cases, however, is data intensive. So, the question arises what to do when we don't have enough data, when for example, we are introducing some new exercises.<\/p> <p>Fortunately, probabilistic programming comes to our aid. Using Greta, we can build a custom IRT model, that allows us to quantify how different features of exercises impact their difficulty. In this talk, we will introduce the audience to the basics of IRT and probabilistic programming through a real-world application - estimating the difficulty of English tasks. For this purpose, we will use the previously mentioned Greta package, which lets us write statistical models in native R and sample from them automatically and efficiently.<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://xeurope-exercises.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://xeurope-exercises.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Damian Wiatrzyk<br/>LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-wiatrzyk-91803072/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-wiatrzyk-91803072/<\/a><\/p> <p>Damian Wiatrzyk graduated from the Poznań University of Technology with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

    "description": "<p>Abstract:<br/>Have you ever found yourself trying to make a plot look prettier?<br/>When looking for color palette inspiration, Josiah often turns to the Instagram page @colorpalette.cinema for inspiration. Color Palette Cinema is an awesome page that takes stills from films and creates a nice palette of 10 colors from the image. These can range from bright hues, to monochromatic masterpieces. To make use of these colors, Josiah created a ¾ baked package {cpcinema}. When sharing an image from using this package on Twitter, it hadn’t crossed his mind that many others may want to use this as well. Josiah will cover the package itself - what it is and what it does, and why he didn’t initially release it but probably should. He will also include a few lessons learned and recommendations as you think about putting your own packages out into the world as well.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Josiah Parry is a self-avowed social data scientist - in that his existence in academe was focused on the social sciences and his professional “career” has been focused on data science. Josiah a graduate of Plymouth State University class of 2018 with a degree in Sociology and Anthropology, a minor in Mathematics, and a certificate in geographic information systems (GIS). April 2020, he earned his MS in Urban Informatics from Northeastern University under Daniel T. O’Brien. The culmination of my MS is the “Urban Informatics Toolkit”, a free online text intended to introduce new students of the field to R. Josiah works on the customer success team at RStudio with public sector customers.<\/p> ",

Thanks to cloud hosting and standardized formats, Earth observation data is getting easier to access, but it’s still hard to analyze lots of it. Dask is a logical solution to this problem. Unlike proprietary platforms, like Google Earth Engine, Dask integrates with the Python data science ecosystem—and new tools like stackstac are opening the door to connecting these enormous datasets of global change with the Python ecosystem. Moreover, with a platform like Coiled, it’s easy to scale out your code to the cloud and run it next to the data, letting you process this planet-sized data.<\/p> <p>After attending, you’ll know:<\/p> <p>– The landscape of geospatial tools in Python, and how they do and don’t fit together<br/>– The limits on Earth-scale data in Dask, and what we’re doing to expand them<br/>– [Sneak peek!] Making an interactive map that renders on-the-fly with Dask, stackstac, and Coiled (aka your own mini Earth Engine)<br/>– The one simple trick to remove all clouds from your satellite imagery that doctors DON’T want you to know!! (lol nope, sorry this doesn’t exist.)<\/p> <p>You’ll also learn:<\/p> <p>– What a STAC and COG is, why stacking your COGs is hard, and how Dask+stackstac make this easy<br/>– How to search Earth observation data in STAC catalogs<br/>– How to stack lots of GeoTIFFs into a timeseries using stackstac<br/>– Compositing, clipping, and basic analysis of raster timeseries in xarray<\/p> <p>Join us on 29th April at 11 am US Eastern time to learn about what could come next for Earth observation in Python!<\/p> <p>REGISTER HERE: <a href=\"https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_El_t3XNxSQ2HCr6zU3QzRQ\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_El_t3XNxSQ2HCr6zU3QzRQ<\/a><\/p> ",

NLP models are great at processing digital text, but many real-word applications use documents with more complex formats. For example, healthcare systems often include visual lab results, sequencing reports, clinical trial forms, and other scanned documents. When we only use an NLP approach for document understanding, we lose layout and style information - which can be vital for document image understanding. New advances in multi-modal learning allow models to learn from both the text in documents (via NLP) and visual layout (via computer vision).<\/p> <p>We provide multi-modal visual document understanding, built on Spark OCR based on the LayoutLM architecture. It achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy in several downstream tasks, including form understanding (from 70.7 to 79.3), receipt understanding (from 94.0 to 95.2) and document image classification (from 93.1 to 94.4).<\/p> <p>Register Here: <a href=\"https://events.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-document-understanding-with-multi-modal-image-text-mining-in-spark-ocr-3\" class=\"linkified\">https://events.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-document-understanding-with-multi-modal-image-text-mining-in-spark-ocr-3<\/a><\/p> ",

My co-authors and I modeled the results of such an MCED test based on published literature when applied to a population of screenable individuals. The model found a potential to intercept 2 in 5 cancer cases, including many cancers generally found only at late stage with current medical practice. This could result in reducing late stage incidence by half, potentially improving mortality.<\/p> <p>Computational modeling is an important aspect of bioinformatics research, and the code underlying such models is a critical part of the scientific endeavor. Code availability is required by many journals, and allows transparency into the scientific results. The code and data underlying these results was written in R, and is available on github. The model, results, and use of R for the project will be discussed, including notes on publication in the real world.<\/p> <p>###############<br/>Julie Silge<\/p> <p>Julia (<a href=\"https://juliasilge.com/about/\" class=\"linkified\">https://juliasilge.com/about/<\/a>) is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio where she works on open source modeling tools.<\/p> <p>ModelOps or MLOps (for “model/machine learning operations”) focuses on the real-world processes involved in building, deploying, and maintaining a model within an organization’s data infrastructure.<\/p> <p>See Julia's recent post for a preview of her talk: <a href=\"https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/08/model-monitoring-with-r-markdown/\" class=\"linkified\">https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/04/08/model-monitoring-with-r-markdown/<\/a><\/p> ",

    "group": "CalgaryR",
    "start": "2021-04-21",
    "description": "<p>We're happy to have a wonderful speaker and topic to start our first virtual meetup. Abed W Ayyad (<a href=\"https://manipulativegerbil.blogspot.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://manipulativegerbil.blogspot.com/<\/a>) will share his exploration of solar PV and how R can be used for solar PV in Alberta.<\/p> <p>Solar energy converted to electricity (photovoltaic, or PV, electricity) seems almost too good to be true when it comes to thinking about ways of reducing global carbon emissions. According to a widely repeated claim, one hour's worth of the solar radiation which falls on the earth's surface could meet human energy needs for one year. Though impressive and technically \"correct\", this is far from being a practical or meaningful calculation. So how much carbon-neutral electricity could someone sitting in the Canadian prairies actually harvest from the sunshine falling on their backyard?<\/p> <p>R lends itself perfectly to the data intensive task of planning and predicting the amount of solar insolation which falls on a given location, and the electricity which one can expect to harvest from it. Following a (very) broad introduction to solar energy and photovoltaics, we will explore a number of packages available in R which make it possible to access and analyse publicly available data on solar insolation, and to understand what this might mean in terms of solar PV potential at a site in Alberta. We will accomplish the latter by doing a walk-through of an example using the nasapower package available in CRAN, as well as a number of the graphics and GIS-related packages also available in R. This talk, aimed at a wide audience of R users, will illustrate why Alberta is a surprisingly perfect location for solar PV deployment and how you can convince yourself of that using R.<\/p> <p>About the speaker: Abed has used R in a variety of settings for seven years now, for GIS/cartography applications, data analysis and linear optimisation. There are many reasons to love R, but the community of users is definitely one of the biggest. Last September, Edmonton became the 10th city which Abed has called home during his life. Abed is looking forward to discovering more of the city, and to cycling to some parks and lakes as the summer goes on and the days get longer.<\/p> ",

    "group": "New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup",
    "start": "2021-04-22",
    "description": "<p>We have our second Rust talk in three months, this time about integrating R and Rust.<\/p> <p>Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Conversations during the meetup are encouraged in the monthly-meetup-chat channel in the nyhackr slack.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>Rust is a relatively new programming language that is rapidly gaining in popularity. It is designed to be suitable for low-level system programming with high performance and low overhead while providing modern abstractions and protection from undefined behavior. The most common application scenarios for Rust are those that otherwise might be suitable for C or C++. As such, Rust may be a good choice for writing extensions to high-level interactive languages such as R. The extendr project was founded with the goal to make writing Rust extensions to R as easy and painless as possible. At the same time, extendr also enables the reverse use case, writing standalone Rust programs that call R code and take advantage of the R runtime. This talk will provide an overview of the extendr API and its key design choices, and it will highlight simple use cases and known pitfalls. The talk is meant primarily as an introduction to Rust for current R users. However, experienced Rust programmers who want to branch out into data science and statistical programming may also find this talk helpful.<\/p> <p>About Claus:<br/>Claus Wilke is the Jane and Roland Blumberg Centennial Professor in Molecular Evolution at The University of Texas at Austin. He holds a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Bochum in Germany, and he received postdoctoral training in biological physics in the lab of Chris Adami at Caltech. Claus Wilke has published extensively in the areas of computational biology, evolutionary biology, protein biochemistry, and virology. He has also authored several popular R packages used for data visualization, such as cowplot, ggridges, and ggtext, and he is a regular contributor to the package ggplot2.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EDT and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Productivity in R often boils down to automating repetitive steps, and iterating over a structured dataset is a common task in more complex data manipulation.<\/p> <p>There are many ways to achieve this: While some feel most comfortable writing procedural for-loops, others Vectorize() their functions in order to pass them multiple values at once. Yet another camp swears by the functional style of purrr's map() and reduce() functions (the tidy alternative to the the *apply family of functions in base R). And a fourth category of useRs struggle to get their head wrapped around serializiation in the first place. (Let's just ignore the hopeless cases who write straight-up recursive functions with no concern for stack size.)<\/p> <p>It has been rumored that a more functional style makes everything faster – but is that really true? Doesn't it make the code just too hard to read? And can any loop really be replaced by a map?<\/p> <p>For our May meeting, let's challenge the functional fanboys and *girls among us. Bring a contained, reproducible example loop (side effects welcome!) and we will ask the mapheads to reformulate it as a higher order function.<\/p> <p>As always, useRs of all backgrounds and at all levels of expertise are invited to participate.

    "description": "<p>Hello R-Ladies!<\/p> <p>Join us on April 28th for a workshop on Tidyverse functions!<\/p> <p>Event Description: Tidyverse functions were designed for their ease of use by humans, and are best known and used in interactive R coding, or as part of a literate code document (e.g., R Markdown) or script, where they are run in the global environment (i.e., not inside a function). Here they feel easy to use and powerful, as you can access things like column names as if they were available to you as objects themselves. However, this ease of use by humans is a trade off for “more work required” when you want to start programming with these. For example, when using them inside functions. In this short workshop, we will introduce what makes programming with Tidyverse functions challenging and how we can rise up to meet these challenges.<\/p> <p>**This workshop assumes you have used 2-3 Tidyverse functions and know how to write a function in R.

    "description": "<p>Hello R-Ladies!<\/p> <p>Join us on May 12th for a workshop on developing R packages!<\/p> <p>Event Description: R packages are a collection of functions, documentation, and sample data. Not only do they provide an excellent framework for organizing your code, but they also make it easier to share code with other R users. In this workshop, we’ll develop a simple R package together to gain an understanding of the key steps of package development. I’ll also reflect on my experiences creating an internal package for my team at the BC Ministry of Health. I hope to shed light on the lesser-known non-technical aspects of package development by discussing how to identify what tools your teammates need to succeed and how to encourage them to adopt your package. This workshop is geared towards (but not limited to) those who are new to developing packages and those who are thinking of creating one to share within their organization and beyond.<\/p> <p>**This workshop assumes you know how to write a function in R and are familiar with the RStudio IDE.

You may have come across this when trying to interpret a residual plot from a logistic regression. For discrete data, these are not really artefacts, they are properties of the distribution of the data, like mean-variance relationships and lots of zeros. Generalised linear models and their extensions model the distribution of the data, including these properties, and so are a good way to remove them, to better see the patterns we are actually interested in. I will talk though some concepts and lots of examples of how we can use models to get the best out of our visualisations of discrete multivariate data in R.<\/p> <p>Biography<br/>Gordana is a statistical consultant and research fellow at UNSW Sydney, with research interests in modelling and visualising multivariate discrete data in ecology.

    "group": "R-Ladies Brisbane",
    "start": "2021-05-11",
    "description": "<p>*What are we going to learn:<br/>Do you use statistical models in R or want to learn? Learn how to best structure your model workflows including reading in data, checking the data, performing analyses, and plotting. The presentation will also go into more advanced topics discussing the R-INLA package for modelling spatio-temporal data. R-INLA is a powerful method that uses integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to create complex models with various types of random effects such as spatial and temporal autocorrelation and run them very fast (<a href=\"https://www.r-inla.org/home\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.r-inla.org/home<\/a>). In this talk, we will specially focus on how to model spatial autocorrelation using coral recovery data. Best for those who are comfortable with R but all are welcome.<\/p> <p>*Who is going to present:<br/>Dr. Julie Vercelloni is a quantitative ecologist that studied Marine Ecology during her undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and statistics applied to coral reef ecology for her PhD. She is now an Associate Investigator at the Queensland University of Technology node of the Australian Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers and works mostly with the Australian Institute of Marine Science.<br/>Julie is doing research on diverse projects that look at combining state-of-the-art technologies including machine learning and virtual reality, and modern statistical modelling methods to help understanding complex problems related to coral reef conservation. She is also a citizen science advocate, working on new types of monitoring for the Great Barrier Reef and Pacific countries.<\/p> <p>* When are we meeting?<br/>The talk will start at 5:30 pm for a ~45 minute presentation, 15 minutes Q&amp;A time with the potential to move to an outside venue for continued socializing and networking.<\/p> <p>* Where are we meeting?<br/>We will meet at QUT Gardens Point campus room Y-801 (in building Y) - this will be a hybrid event with a Zoom link available.<br/>map: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/4H51oEEun6JuewVn6\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/4H51oEEun6JuewVn6<\/a><br/>DIRECTIONS TO THE ROOM - Y block/building is next to River Stage in QUT Gardens Point. The elevators to the 8th floor are on the side of the building facing P block and should not require card access. Please follow the hall to the right upon exiting the elevator on floor 8 to room Y-801, the first meeting room at the end of the hall.<\/p> <p>We look forward to seeing you there!<\/p> <p>R-Ladies Brisbane<\/p> <p>********************************************************************************<br/>Photos, Films and all other media/recordings: Photographs and/or video/other media will be taken at events held by this community.

    "description": "<p>Just getting involved with R or want to level up your skills? Have you used base-R but are still trying to wrap your head around the tidyverse \"pipe\" (%&gt;%)? Have a messy dataset and don't know where to start? Seen beautiful visualizations on Twitter and want to make your own?<\/p> <p>If you’ve answered ‘yes’ to at least one of these questions, fear no more! In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with. You will be able to create new columns and summary tables, subset interesting rows or columns, and combine and reshape dataframes. We will also dive into ggplot, one of the best tools for creating great-looking bar charts, scatterplots, and more!<\/p> <p>This is (currently) a five-part series, aimed at total beginners and/or people with some experience in base-R or tidyverse who are looking to freshen up or expand their skills. Feel free to join at any point, we will briefly review the previous topic at the beginning of each session.<\/p> <p>January 20th {Part 1}: The R &amp; R-Studio ABCs (packages, files, data types &amp; basic data exploration)<br/>February 17th {Part 2}: Tidy data &amp; introduction to data wrangling (tibbles, renaming, reordering, subsetting)<br/>March 17th {Part 3}: Data wrangling with dplyr (new columns, if-else statements, summary tables, joining dataframes)<br/>April 21st {Part 4}: Introduction to visualizations with ggplot (line graphs, bar charts, scatterplots, histograms, and more!)<br/>May 19th {Part 5}: Advanced topics in wrangling and ggplot (pivoting, ggplot style options, etc.)<\/p> <p>Please install R and R-Studio before joining: <a href=\"https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html<\/a><\/p> <p>Image by the amazing @allison_horst: <a href=\"https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>En este meetup descubriremos en primer lugar, qué es una red neuronal, pero también, qué tiene que ver una de nuestras neuronas con las redes neuronales de las que posiblemente hayas oído hablar. Hablaremos de las redes neuronales más famosas y por supuesto, de los principales usos que se les da hoy en día. Una vez que conozcamos esos usos, vamos a implementar una red neuronal en R, ¿vamos? sí, ya verás que no es tan difícil. Las redes neuronales aprenden a través de ejemplos, como tú y yo, y ahí está la clave.<\/p> <p>En esta ocasión contamos con la crack Clara Piniella, donde nos ha dejado esta bonita biografía para que conozcáis más sobre su trayectoria:<\/p> <p>Me presento, soy Clara Piniella Martínez, y podría resumirlo todo con que soy graduada en Administración y Dirección de Empresas por la Universidad de Málaga, pero, eso es solo el principio. Mi pasión por entender aquello que hace únicas a las personas, y cómo poder hacer esto un valor añadido para la empresa me llevó hasta Australia, Melbourne, donde tras 12 meses obtuve el Diploma de Liderazgo y Dirección. Conocimientos que durante un año y medio pude poner en práctica en el departamento de Recursos Humanos de la empresa LeasePlan. Es aquí donde descubro que estas personas, tú y yo, somos una fuente imparable de datos que bien gestionados pueden no quitarnos poder, sino dárnoslo. Por este motivo en octubre de 2019 decidí embarcarme en esta aventura del análisis de datos, el machine learning. Acabo de llegar, pero cada día tengo más claro que he llegado para quedarme, para aprender, para compartir lo que sé y para participar en esta, la revolución del siglo XXI.<\/p> <p>¡Os esperamos el 11 de mayo!<\/p> ",

Brooke will discuss \"Flexible reproducibility in data workflows\".<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Flexible reproducibility in data workflows<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: Sometimes, when data collected for an analysis doesn’t change, the process of tidying is a one-time investment. Other times, raw data changes by the hour or minute, requiring automated systems of extraction, transformation, and loading. But what of the case in the middle? How should analysts and data scientists handle the system changes, the month-over-month tweaks, and data sources that involve a human in the loop?<\/p> <p>This talk will cover strategies and tactics for creating resilient and flexible reproducibility in data workflows.

The nyccensus package is a simple data-sharing package meant to ease the pains of accessing and wrangling publicly-available response rate data from the 2020 Decennial Census as well as other relevant demographic data from the American Community Survey at various geographic levels in New York City. I will share some lessons learned and examples of how these data can be used to better understand and address equity issues in NYC.<\/p> <p>Bio: Natalie O'Shea is a researcher and data visualization specialist with a passion for equity, accessibility, and human-centered design. She started her data science journey during graduate school, falling in love with all things R in her coursework and research.

She is currently working as a Data Visualization Analyst on the Research and Learning Engineering team at Edmentum.<\/p> <p>\"Creating Production Level Data Science Code\"<br/>Speaker: Megan Robertson<\/p> <p>Abstract: Writing code is a big part of working as a data scientist. You write code throughout all stages of a project from exploratory data analysis to building models. This talk focuses on creating production code from a proof of concept analysis or model. How do you organize and adapt all the code created to get to a proof of concept? Do you feel overwhelmed by everything you need to do? At the end of this talk you’ll walk away with tips and strategies to make your own production code.<\/p> <p>Bio: Megan Robertson is a Senior Data Scientist at Nike. She has multiple years of experience applying data science in retail settings. She first became interested in math and statistics through sports analytics, and wrote her Master’s thesis in collaboration with an NBA team.

S4 classes in R give structure to your data and help you organize your methods. They also help signal to your team members proper use of the data structures you define and what methods are available, in essence, how to use your code properly, and also, how to add to it or modify it later on.<\/p> <p>In this talk, we will empower ourselves by reminding ourselves that data scientists are a particular class of programmers (distinct from those who create PC/console games, those who create mobile apps, those who create websites, etc) but programmers all the same. Then we will briefly discuss the benefits of code encapsulation, especially with respect to packages and S4 classes while touching briefly on other OOP systems in R. We will discuss when and how to implement them, and how to structure your code base in a clean, effective, and consistent manner so that it's clear and easy to understand for your teammates and to yourself.<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Ezra Tucker is the Director of Data Science at Energetic Insurance<\/p> <p>Energetic Insurance is a Managing General Underwriter (MGU) with a novel, data-driven approach to develop new risk management products to unlock exponential growth in the renewable energy industry<\/p> ",

Through interpolation, the resulting splines can be used to construct high resolution data sets that are more amenable to automated analysis for pattern detection. The application of smoothing splines will be covered in three parts: 1) the key parameters and coding of smoothing splines in R will be discussed using a Shiny app designed to determine inflection points in chemical titrations, 2) a method for detecting complex patterns in time-series data will be discussed using a model designed to identify the ‘Cup and Handle’ pattern in stock prices, and 3) a theoretical discussion of potential applications to generate input and output data for supervised and unsupervised learning.<\/p> <p>Presenter: Dr. Fred Franken<\/p> <p>Fred Franken, Ph.D., has over 15 years of experience in data analysis.

    "description": "<p>When we make an inventory of opportunities to add value to organizations with data, often there is low hanging fruit that does not require much investment in actual data analysis, but can be solved by automating data aspects of business processes. In fact there is a whole industry around this called robotic process automation (RPA). But where RPA offers a low-code approach to setting up automation tasks, it is easy to undervalue R for setting up these tasks with R code.<\/p> <p>In this talk I would like to share some of the experiences we have had automating tasks with R. The tools we use range from great packages like fs to work with the filesystem on the R side. But there are also packages to make it easier to work with cron jobs on Linux (cronR) and the task scheduler on Windows (taskscheduleR).<\/p> <p>When you combine this with other tools of the automation trade like httr to access API's or plumber to write API's there is practically no limit to what you can achieve using only R and readily available tools on linux and windows. I hope that the talk will inspire a lively discussion where we share experiences and ideas about automating processes with R.<\/p> <p>Frans van Dunné (<a href=\"https://www.fransvandunne.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.fransvandunne.com/<\/a>) is Chief Data Officer at ixpantia (<a href=\"https://www.ixpantia.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ixpantia.com/<\/a>).

    "description": "<p>The job of a data engineer is to build, manage, and optimize systems for transforming data into forms that facilitate analysis. Despite the broad adoption of R as a language for data science, it has taken a back seat to Python and other languages in the area of data engineering. But this is beginning to change. Data engineering tasks that were previously infeasible in R are becoming straightforward thanks to recent developments in the Apache Arrow project and the R package `arrow`. Arrow provides tools for working with tabular data that emphasize performance, efficiency, standardization, and interoperability with other languages and systems in the broader data ecosystem. Using the R package `arrow`, it is now possible to implement many data engineering and ETL tasks entirely in R, avoiding the overhead of switching to another language Python or using a framework like Spark.<\/p> <p>All skill levels are welcomed.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30pm - 6:40pm Introductions<br/>6:40pm - 7:20pm Topic Presentation<br/>7:20pm - 7:30pm Closing Remarks<\/p> <p>(Topic presentations sometimes run longer than 40 minutes)<\/p> <p>This meetup will be 100% virtual!

    "description": "<p>Our June Meetup will be a remote gathering; the Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Infographics are everywhere, and when well-designed can be a fantastic way of sharing data highlights in an engaging and visually appealing way to non-technical audiences. Typically infographics are custom made by a graphic designer who has been provided the numbers that will be represented in the graphic, and therefore can be time-intensive to produce. Producing more than one infographic of the same design to display different values (for instance, for different geographical areas) has a linear increase in production time for each n+1 graphic once the basic design time has been accounted for. This talk will describe a novel method for producing infographics using R that allows for dynamically adjusting the graphical elements based on any number of data values and rapidly producing bespoke versions. A walkthrough of the process used to create 3,142 custom infographics (one for each county in the US) will be presented to illustrate the process.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Zadra, PhD is a Director of Data Science at the non-profit Sorenson Impact Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. He combines his skills in statistics, programming, and data visualization with expertise in data privacy and policy to empower governments, nonprofits, and philanthropists working in a wide array of issue areas. His areas of focus include criminal justice data (including work with the PEW Charitable Trusts, Utah Department of Corrections, Utah Indigent Defense Commission, and Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice), early- and higher-education data including a multi-year project supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as other issue areas like homelessness or poverty, and has worked on many smaller projects building evaluations and impact measurements for a variety of social-good non-profits around the country. He received his doctorate from the University of Virginia, where he studied cognitive science and neuroscience and designed and conducted rigorous RCTs - and also fell in love with R way back in 2006!<\/p> ",

Social vulnerability is defined as the resilience of communities when dealing with external stresses on health, such as age, housing, race/ethnicity, and more. For analysis, we used multiple linear regression to determine which social vulnerability variables are most directly related with hospital capacity in each county in California, using average bed utilization rate as our measure of hospital capacity. The significant predictors from our model were: the proportion of the county’s population under 17, the percentage of individuals reporting severe housing situations, the proportion of the county's population that are Black, the percentage of single parent households, and the percentage of households with more people than rooms. We then developed a county-level social vulnerability index (SVI) and concluded that there was a relationship between the SVI and COVID-19 case prevalence per county after mapping both of them using Tableau. Our findings suggest that more socially vulnerable counties are less equipped to handle impacts of COVID-19 and more resources should be allocated to them to establish equitable health outcomes. This project was originally created in May 2020, with updates to COVID case rates in December 2020.<\/p> <p># Predicting Benzodiazepines Use<br/>Speakers: Tiffany Feng, Eustina Kim, Diana Pham, Kienna Qin<br/>Seniors, Department of Statistics, UCLA<\/p> <p>Bio: Tiffany Feng, UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Digital Humanities minor; Eustina Kim: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Digital Humanities minor; Diana Pham: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Global Health minor; Kienna Qin: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major<\/p> <p>Abstract: This project explores which characteristics among students, health care professionals, and veterans determined the use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) in a sample of participants in the United States during 2018. BZDs are a type of drug that produces sedation and lowers anxiety levels. They are the most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., and, unfortunately, are frequently abused and taken with other drugs. We used multinomial logistic regression and various data visualizations to determine that having a history of drug use, mental illness, and prescriptions for opioids for treating pain are important in predicting the use of BZD for all three occupations in our sample. The largest impacts for each occupation were a history of drug use for students, mental illness and opioid prescriptions for pain for veterans, and there were similar influences for each category for health professionals. Although our data was not a representative sample, this could still demonstrate the importance of investigating the unique differences in determining BZD use for each occupation, which could lead into interventions such as targeted programs to reduce BZD misuse in each occupation. Hopefully with these insights, we can make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by the misuse of BZDs in the United States.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

They maintain the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. They nourish other living organisms and supply psychological benefits to humans as well, improving our moods and beautifying the landscape around us. But plants don’t just passively provide. They also take action.<\/p> <p>Beronda L. Montgomery explores the vigorous, creative lives of organisms often treated as static and predictable. In fact, plants are masters of adaptation. They “know” what and who they are, and they use this knowledge to make a way in the world. Plants experience a kind of sensation that does not require eyes or ears. They distinguish kin, friend, and foe, and they are able to respond to ecological competition despite lacking the capacity of fight-or-flight. Plants are even capable of transformative behaviors that allow them to maximize their chances of survival in a dynamic and sometimes unfriendly environment.<\/p> <p>Lessons from Plants enters into the depth of botanic experience and shows how we might improve human society by better appreciating not just what plants give us but also how they achieve their own purposes. What would it mean to learn from these organisms, to become more aware of our environments and to adapt to our own worlds by calling on perception and awareness? Montgomery’s meditative study puts before us a question with the power to reframe the way we live: What would a plant do?<\/p> ",

    "start": "2021-06-01",
    "description": "<p>For the June 1st edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Dr. Danica Slavish as our guest speaker. Dr. Slavish will introduce the topic of Latent Profile Analyses using the tidyLPA framework.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Latent Profile Analyses using tidyLPA<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: Do adolescents who try alcohol before age 15 have worse health in adulthood than those who try alcohol later in life? Are there different subtypes of COVID-19 symptoms? How do these subtypes predict hospitalization risk? What types of advertisements most strongly predict if someone buys a product?<\/p> <p>All these questions can be answered using the statistical technique, latent profile analysis (LPA). LPA is a powerful statistical tool to identify hidden clusters in your data based on a set of variables. LPA is superior to other data reduction techniques like k-means clustering in that it generates probabilities of group membership. In this talk, a brief introduction to LPA using the R package tidyLPA will be covered. Using sample data on daily sleep patterns of nurses, we will walk through an example using the current gold standard 3-step approach: 1) estimate class membership, 2) extract class probabilities, 3) examine predictors of class membership. Best practices and advantages and disadvantages of LPA will be discussed.<\/p> <p>Bio: Dr. Danica Slavish is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of North Texas. Danica’s research focuses on how sleep problems and stressful life experiences interact to predict health outcomes across time. Her research team uses a variety of statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal data in R, including multilevel modeling, time-varying effect modeling, network analyses, and Bayesian analyses. Danica currently teaches courses in health psychology, advanced statistics, and research methods. Before joining UNT, Danica completed her Ph.D. in biobehavioral health at Penn State, where she was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. She holds an undergraduate degree in psychology from Beloit College, in Beloit, WI.<\/p> <p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danicaslavish\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/danicaslavish<\/a><\/p> <p>Website:<\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.
