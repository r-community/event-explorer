In this talk I will discuss the fundamentals of building a web application using HTML/JavaScript/CSS, and how those fundamentals are used to build web applications in Shiny using R, using examples I have created in both environments. For anyone who wants to understand website structure or get the most out of their Shiny app, I hope this talk will shed some light!<\/p> <p>Talk 2:<br/>Speaker: Amy Tzu-Yu Chen (@amy17519), Data Scientist at System1<br/>Title: Data Science Reporting: Tips and Tricks for useRs<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>We (data practitioners) spend most of time working on data analysis and model development but we often forget that it is as important to advocate and maintain model health, especially in a production environment. Building data science reports ahead of time can help. In this talk, let's talk about how to make useful data science reports for data scientists and business stakeholders. In this talk, we will first walk through what data science reporting means and how it is different from BI and general-purpose dashboards. Next, we explore different options for producing data science reports in a \"loud\" and clear way for data scientists and other technical and non-technical business stakeholders. Throughout the talk, I will introduce some useful R packages and tricks for building your own reports.<\/p> <p>Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>Timeline:<br/>6:30: Socializing<br/>7:00-8:00: Talks<br/>8:00: Socializing<\/p> <p>Address:<br/>Room 115/116<br/>USC<br/>2001 N.

    "start": "2019-11-19",
    "description": "<p>**Note, this month our meetup will be a week earlier to accommodate the Thanksgiving week**<\/p> <p># Introduction<\/p> <p>This month we are lucky to have two of our seasoned speakers presenting. Alan, from RStudio, will give his much-anticipated talk on integrating React.js with Shiny. The reactR package has been updated to allow you to integrate with htmlwidgets and access all the React components. Emil will talk about his experience integrating the textrecipes into an ecosystem of packages and the lessons that he has learnt. This is becoming increasingly more important as the number of packages grows and so does the complexity of the analysis pipeline.<\/p> <p>Come early, network, enjoy the food and talks.<\/p> <p># Schedule<br/>6:30 - 6:50 Networking<br/>6:50 - 7:00 Welcome &amp; general announcement<br/>7:00 - 7:30 Integrating React.js and Shiny<br/>7:30 - 8:00 Building a package that fits into an evolving ecosystem<br/>8:00 - 8:30 Networking and Clean-up<\/p> <p># Talk 1<\/p> <p>## Title: Integrating React.js and Shiny<br/>## Speaker: Alan Dipert<br/>## Abstract<br/>React.js is a thriving JavaScript library that eases encapsulating and sharing sophisticated component libraries. The React.js ecosystem is filled with components for doing everything from color selection (react-color) to animation (react-spring). While it's always been technically possible to integrate React.js components with Shiny applications, it hasn't always been particularly obvious how. To make it easier, we augmented the excellent reactR package with functions specifically designed to make it easier to create new htmlwidgets, inputs, and outputs based on React.js components. In this talk, I will further motivate and demonstrate these new tools and do my best to empower the audience to try them out.<\/p> <p># Talk 2<\/p> <p>## Title: Building a package that fits into an evolving ecosystem<br/>## Speaker: Emil Hvitfeldt<br/>## Abstract<br/>With an ever-increasing amount of textual data is available to us, having a well-thought-out toolchain for modelling is crucial. tidymodels is a recent effort to create a modelling framework that shares the underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures of the tidyverse. textrecipes joined the roster a year ago and provided an exciting bridge to text preprocessing. This talk tells the tale of the package textrecipes; starting with the Github issue that sparked the idea for the package, go over the trials and challenges associated with building a package that heavily integrates with other packages all the way to the release on CRAN.<\/p> ",

Then this hacking session is for you!<\/p> <p>CRUG is working together with the City of Chicago to host a hackathon to develop a prototype dashboard using R and Shiny. We want to understand where, when, and why traffic crashes are happening, and what is effective for preventing crashes.<\/p> <p>We are looking for help in developing concepts, graphical components, and / or prototype dashboards using R and Shiny. We are looking for contributions from people with different skill sets. You don’t necessarily have to be “technical” so long as you are interested in the problem and committed to contribute.<\/p> <p>Through your participation you will have the opportunity to work directly on a City of Chicago project on our official GitHub repository!<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Chicago/vision-zero-dashboard\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/Chicago/vision-zero-dashboard<\/a><\/p> <p>VISION ZERO CHICAGO<\/p> <p>Vision Zero Chicago (VZC) is a commitment and approach to eliminating fatalities and serious injuries from traffic crashes. Vision Zero is an international movement that is changing the way we look at traffic safety.<\/p> <p>The Vision Zero philosophy is that even a single life lost due to a traffic crash is unacceptable, and that everyone has a right to walk, bike, take transit, and drive safely. It’s a whole new approach that treats fatalities and serious injuries as preventable.<\/p> <p>Please take a moment to read the introductory material on Chicago Vision Zero: <a href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/vision-zero-chicago.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/vision-zero-chicago.html<\/a><\/p> <p>DETAILS<\/p> <p>Did you know that the City’s open data portal publishes detailed traffic crash information? As of September 2017, Chicago implemented an electronic crash reporting system that is operated by Chicago Police Department, and that crash data is published on a nightly basis on the open data portal.<\/p> <p>We would like to use this data, along with historical crash data to track our progress on Vision Zero goals and find actionable and useful insights about crashes.<\/p> <p>We will manage the work through the City of Chicago’s GitHub account and site. Users will be given write access to the dashboard repository for the duration of the weekend. We will ask that each team (or individual) work in their own branch.<\/p> <p>This is not a competition, and we do not expect to have a final working prototype at the end of the session. We expect to consider and incorporate elements from the branches.<\/p> <p>Depending on the level of interest, we may have an ongoing effort through the Chi Hack Night Meetup! More about this at the event.<\/p> <p>Ultimately you have a real opportunity to help impact our City and your community, and drive real decision making through your insight and analysis.<\/p> <p>Finally, although the primary data set is the crash data, there are many other data sets which can be brought into the analysis!<\/p> <p>AGENDA<\/p> <p>We are offering two sessions.

What is the impact of containers and containerization on the work of data scientists? How does the average R User use these technologies?<br/>This CRUG meetup will attempt to answer these questions.<\/p> <p>1) Containers for Data Scientists - Troy Hernandez - 6pm<\/p> <p>Troy will give a brief introduction to containers, images, orchestration, and microservices. He will then lay out 3 popular use-cases for data scientists using containers.<\/p> <p>2) The Rocker Project - Dirk Eddelbuettel - 6:15pm<\/p> <p>As usual, Dirk was ahead of the curve. He started the Rocker Project (Docker Containers for the R Environment) with Carl Boettiger in June of 2014. After 5 years the project has over 200 forks and 1000 stars on Github, and over two million downloads on Docker Hub.<br/><a href=\"https://www.rocker-project.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.rocker-project.org/<\/a><\/p> <p>CRUG is thrilled to have Dirk present the Rocker project, a little of its history, and will then do a demo of a couple of his favorite applications of Rocker containers.<\/p> <p>3) Rocking Kubernetes - Ray Buhr - 7pm<\/p> <p>Ray has been using Rocker containers in production since 2017. In a prod environment, container images are scaled up to 10s, 100s, or 1,000,000s of deployed containers. That kind of scale requires some management/orchestration: Enter Kubernetes (k8s).<\/p> <p>Ray will take a Shiny app running locally and show you how to run it on k8s in the cloud. He will also discuss some considerations for working with data science container workloads in production environments.<\/p> <p>###############################################<\/p> <p>As usual, IBM is sponsoring the meetup and providing food and beverages. If you'd like to do some pre-learning, there is an IBM meetup focused exclusively on Kubernetes/container orchestration on Thursday, November 14th:<br/><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/IBM-Cloud-Chicago/events/265932434/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/IBM-Cloud-Chicago/events/265932434/<\/a><\/p> ",

Cependant, la documentation semble prendre beaucoup de temps et, lorsqu'elle est incluse, elle est habituellement la dernière chose ajoutée à un projet. Pour un projet reproductible, les workflows peuvent être présentés dans un fichier Rmarkdown, combinant explications et analyses.

Chris will walk us through building a simple package that incorporates a number of things we all see - wrapper functions, documentation, packaged datasets - and some things we don't see but can appreciate all the same (tests).<\/p> <p>What this will do is wrap lm(), cor() and a few other standard R functions with functions that let a less-experienced-with-R analyst perform linear regressions with correlation matrices and data plots. It will include packaged R data files, some vignettes and in-code documentation.<\/p> <p>• What to bring<br/>If you wish to bring a laptop to follow along, code and slides will be posted ~24 hours in advance at <a href=\"https://github.com/TampaUseRs/TampaUseRs/tree/master/meetups\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/TampaUseRs/TampaUseRs/tree/master/meetups<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN), or simply “Deep Learning”, are recently gaining more and more popularity in the Data Science industry. They might seem overwhelming for those who never tried to use them, however, the truth is that the basic theory behind it is not that hard to understand. You might be surprised that the simplest neural network is just a linear function. You also might be surprised that learning how to create a Deep Learning model does not require a PhD in math related subject.<\/p> <p>With recent frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras the effort needed to build a DNN is similar to the effort needed to build any other Machine Learning model.<\/p> <p>On this practice oriented workshop you will learn the basics of how DNN work and you will implement a simple one by yourself using the Keras framework in R. We will work on a very simple, yet real world example to showcase the mechanics that powers Deep Learning. We will predict the rent price of an apartment based on its characteristics using the publicly available data originating from AirBnb.<\/p> <p>The instructors Mikołaj Olszewski and Mikołaj Bogucki are both experienced Data Scientists and the founders of idash.pl, a startup which provides Data Science training. They are passionate about Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and crazy about finding new ways to efficiently communicate results of their analyses. They love to learn new things and to teach others.<\/p> <p>Important notes:<br/>We are sorry but to ensure a quality workshop, spots will be limited.<br/>Additionally, participants should bring their own laptops and have Google accounts as we will work on Google Colab.<\/p> ",

(Explained through using tidymodels, Plumber, and Shiny) - Presented by Josiah Parry<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Old Town Road, is it hip-hop or country? With its initial release, Lil Nas X declared it a country song. Billboard, the industry standard for ranking songs, artists, and albums eventually intervened making a bold statement that the song is not country and would from there forth be classified as hip-hop.<\/p> <p>This serves as the basis for a case study to illustrate the process of developing a sophisticated model and productionizing it using contemporary tools in the R ecosystem. This is done by developing an ensemble model that classifies between country or hip-hop based on its lyrics and audio features. I then explore productionizing the R model by creating a plumber API and a shiny application which are subsequently hosted on RStudio Connect.<\/p> <p>Bio:<\/p> <p>Josiah Parry's interests include social science, politics, espresso, data science, and music. He gets to indulge in some of these interests as a Customer Success Representative at RStudio.

Stock, Raum \"PARIS\" (C2-58)<\/p> <p>***<br/>Speaker 1: Benjamin Perucco | Data Analyst @ Zurich Airport<\/p> <p>Title: Predicting the departing runway of a flight based on a classification tree model<\/p> <p>Zurich airport’s capacity is restricted by highly complex runway and airspace dependencies. One of these dependencies exists between departing aircraft in southerly direction on runway 16 and arriving traffic from the north on runway 14. Because of this, and during times of high departure demand on runway 16, the arrival flow is regulated by the air navigation service provider. These regulations allow for departures on runway 16 to take off without congesting the airspace with arriving aircraft. However, for such a regulation to be effective, it must be set in place well in advance, in fact before aircraft actually have departed at their origin. Therefore, a reliable estimate on expected departure demand on runway 16 a couple of hours ahead highly supports the decision whether regulations are necessary or not.<\/p> <p>We present several models to predict the departing runway for aircrafts in order to support the air navigation service provider with this decision. The latest of these models incorporates data from different sources like flight plan and weather model data and resulted in a classification tree model which can predict the runway with high accuracy. Besides insight on the steps undertaken for building the model, we also provide an outlook on how such models can help to improve operations at Zurich airport in the future.<\/p> <p>--<\/p> <p>Speaker 2: Joao Banha | Business Analyst @ Swiss International Air Lines<\/p> <p>Title: NOTAM message classifier<\/p> <p>A notice to airmen (NOTAM) is a semi-encoded message to alert personnel and systems concerned with flight operations of potential hazards along a flight route. Each year over 1 million NOTAM messages are issued worldwide and this number is growing. The messages contain crucial information for pilots, yet their number poses an increasing operational challenge, when messages have to be processed and classified manually.<br/>We created a machine learning binary classifier in R to deal with this challenge. This classifier provides a recommendation on the overall importance of these messages. Exploring the data resulted in the conclusion that a large fraction of messages can be automatically classified with high confidence. R Shiny is also used for the visualization of results.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>By: John Snyder<\/p> <p>Interpreting the effects of individual variables from flexible machine learning models such as random forests or neural networks can be a difficult task. Typically, the flexibility of these methods tends to obfuscate these effects in favor of superior predictive performance. This tradeoff can often leave the data scientist wondering how their inputs are working for them to achieve their predictive accuracy.<\/p> <p>Visualization techniques such as Partial Dependence(PD), Individual Conditional Expectation(ICE) and Accumulated Local Effect(ALE) plots exist to recover some of the global interpretability we would get with a parametric model such as regression. These techniques frequently shed valuable insights into how the features relate to the target variable and make explaining results much easier.<\/p> <p>This month, I will first provide a brief background on why these types of procedures are valuable additions to a data scientist's analytical toolkit. Then, I will discuss the practical usage of the Interpretable Machine Learning(iml) R package, which provides a suite of functionality for analyzing any black box machine learning model. Specifically, we will discuss how to create and interpret PD, ICE, and ALE plots.<\/p> <p>The meetup will be in The Showroom in the CIC building at 20 South Sarah Street, St. Louis, MO 63108.

An analysis of CRAN package maintainers estimated that fewer than 15% were women, and a useR! participant survey found that women were less likely than men to have experience contributing to or writing packages. In 2017 it was rebranded to accommodate other under-represented groups such as LGBTQI, minority ethnic groups, and people with disabilities. The task force is organised as a core team plus a number of sub-teams that focus on particular tasks. One of these is a Teaching Team covering methodology, materials and workshops designed for under-represented groups. In this talk I will describe a workshop particularly intended to increase the number and visibility of women, people of colour and LBGTQ+ individuals in the scientific coding community. Coding is a valuable skill in research and many degrees courses in the life sciences provide training in programming. These equip individuals to implement programming-based solutions to scientific problems but rarely to professionally document and disseminate their code.<\/p> ",

This is roughly my motto of continuous improvement and I'd like to share with the MelbURN community, a collection of learnings that I have acquired over the past few years. Whether it is following the DRY principle, or vowing to never write a for loop again, or learning to prepare recipes and bake them in R, a lot of things I have learnt have made me feel a lot better about how problems are tackled. Unlike other talks where you might learn about a particular package or technique, this talk will introduce you to some of the ways in which you can think about and be better at writing R code.<\/p> <p>Kaushik Lakshman is a data scientist and a massive fan of R. He works at Betfair where he uses R to analyse the incredibly rich and extensive betting exchange data, to create data products and create business value using data science. Outside of work he loves to have a go at building sports prediction models with the hope that one day it will help him retire at the beach (but has so far been very unsuccessful)!<\/p> <p>Second presentation: Getting your colleagues started with R<\/p> <p>R is fantastic piece of software which is widely used in academia and commercial sector – if you are coming to this talk then you are likely already a fan. In this presentation Lyndon will draw on his experience of teaching R to hundreds of academics and business professionals (and thousands of students) to discuss tips, tricks, and things to consider when introducing and teaching your colleagues how to use R. This will include different approaches to teaching and supporting colleagues, some useful tools and resources, and the different needs and support that your colleagues may require.<\/p> <p>Dr Lyndon Walker is a former statistics lecturer who is now a part-time statistician for SACS Consulting - a psychometrics and organisational psychology company, founder of Veritate Data Science - an education and statistics training consultancy, and investor/advisor to Preventure - a workplace safety wearable tech startup.

Siamo piene di nuove idee!<\/p> <p>Chi siamo e a chi sono rivolti i nostri eventi?<br/>RLadies Bari è un gruppo locale che si rifà a RLadies Global (<a href=\"https://rladies.org/about-us/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rladies.org/about-us/<\/a>), un’organizzazione internazionale non-profit con circa[masked] membri in 46 diversi paesi del mondo. Lo scopo dell’organizzazione è di promuovere diversità ed equità di genere nella comunità di utenti di R.<\/p> <p>Se utilizzi, o vorresti imparare ad utilizzare R, questo è il gruppo giusto! Tutti sono benvenuti gratuitamente, previa registrazione a , ed hanno la possibilità di imparare in un contesto amicale e di supporto. Ci sono anche occasioni di mentorship per condividere le proprie conoscenze come speakers. Queste opportunità sono preferenzialmente rivolte a donne e minoranze.<\/p> <p>Il prossimo evento<br/>Cosa imparerai?<br/>Attraverso una breve introduzione ai sistemi di version control, come Git e GitHub, imparerai come utilizzare questi strumenti per rendere il tuo lavoro più efficiente ed evitare errori che potrebbero costarti giornate intere di programmazione. NB: questi sistemi non si limitano al mondo di R ma sono diffusissimi tra programmatori e data scientists che utilizzano i più svariati linguaggi di programmazione.<\/p> <p>A seguire, parleremo di RMarkdown, un formato di file che permette di creare reports in Word|PDF|HTML contenente sia testo scritto (i.e., plain text) che codice di programmazione. Questo è estremamente utile quando devi condividere il tuo lavoro con altri colleghi o supervisori. Imparerai a utilizzare RMarkdown attraverso una session pratica per capire le potenzialità di questo formato e vedere come creare reports personalizzati per le tue esigenze.<\/p> <p>Negli ultimi 30 minuti faremo networking per conoscerci meglio. IC406 ha gentilmente deciso di offrire ai partecipanti snacks e bibite per rendere questo momento sociale più piacevole (se avete allergie importanti, scriveteci a [masked]).<\/p> <p>Cosa devi portare con te?<br/>• Volontà e curiosità per imparare!<br/>• Rispetto e pazienza verso gli altri partecipanti secondo il codice di comportamento di RLadies (<a href=\"https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rladies.org/code-of-conduct/<\/a>)<br/>• Un laptop con installata una versione recente di RStudio Desktop (qui trovate l’ultima versione: <a href=\"https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/<\/a>)<\/p> <p>Contatti:<br/>Sara Iacozza [masked]<br/>Giovanna de Vincenzo [masked]<br/>Francesca Lamontanara [masked]<\/p> <p>Ringraziamo IC406 per supportarci e sponsorizzarci per l'evento!<\/p> ",

    "title": "CalgaryR: Rig State Detection; Model Agnostic Approach; Asset Failure Susceptibility",
    "group": "CalgaryR",
    "start": "2019-11-20",
    "description": "<p>Three speakers are contributing to our meetup in November. Doors will open at 5:30PM where members can enjoy pizza, soda, and networking. The first talk will begin at 6:00PM.<\/p> <p>Talk 1: Rig State Detection by David Shakleton -- Over the past two or three years Independent Data Services (IDS) have shifted from ‘proof of concept’ projects to global live rollouts of their in-time (near real-time) lean automated reporting (LAR) and drilling performance monitoring (DPM) services. Some of our projects begin their lives in R, as RStudio and Shiny apps lend themselves beautifully to the rapid prototyping of ideas - by being able to ingest large amounts of data, and perform analytics accessed through an easily-adjustable user interface. The first step to realizing these automated reporting &amp; analytics services in the upstream oil &amp; gas industry is 'rig state detection' - a process where data is taken from key sensors on the rig and run through logic-based and/or machine learning algorithms to determine what the rig, drill string, etc., are doing. Rig states are then used to build activity descriptions for daily reporting, and generate charts and dashboards for key drilling parameters, with web-based charts and dashboards available from anywhere, any device within moments of the event. IDS have made further strides to automate daily operational reporting by automatically ingesting pdf/Excel/WITSML/etc. data to auto-populate much of the daily report.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Model Agnostic Approach by Alastair Muir -- The real value of Machine Learning to businesses is when it is used to create a deep understanding of the problem. The predictive power of modern machine learning algorithms comes at the cost of decreased transparency. This is why Black Box solutions, however accurate, are not immediately accepted by themselves. You should come away from this session with a toolkit you can use to probe and understand your models. This could be for regulatory requirements, change management resistance, or just general acceptance. We will be using a typical example of a non-linear process modeled using different traditional statistical and deep learning models. So, we are going with the “model agnostic” approach.<\/p> <p>Talk 3: Asset Failure Susceptibility Ranking, using LambdaMART, by Busayo Akinloye -- The electric distribution system is one of the most diverse systems in the electrical grid. It consists of both overhead and underground assets. Growing power quality and reliability expectations from regulatory authorities and customers demand minimal downtime of equipment. Metrics such as System Average Interruption Frequency Index, and System Average Interruption Duration Index are closely being monitored by electric utilities and form a major part of the business’ performance indices. These growing expectations, coupled with aging assets and budget constraints require innovative and cost-effective ways to realize actionable intelligence in order to optimize spending, while improving or maintaining the quality and reliability of the electric grid. Data analysis offers a unique solution that is reproducible across all asset infrastructure of an electric grid. It employs complex machine learning and statistical algorithms to extract actionable insights and learnings from historical data. These insights will help utilities better allocate both financial and human resources to the most failure susceptible assets, truly making data-driven decisions. I will discuss the development of an asset failure susceptibility ranking system on the Calgary area Underground Residential Distribution System. This system employs the supervised ranking system used by information retrieval systems. The framework of this ranking system can be applied to all distribution system assets, due to the reproducible nature of the statistical algorithms it employs.<\/p> <p>This event is supported by the Pacific Institutes of the Mathematical Sciences and the Cenovus Energy.<\/p> ",

However, it is not perfect. To improve the developer experience, consolidate functionality, and expand on the ability to be deployed, TensorFlow 2 was developed. As of September 30th 2019, TensorFlow 2 is out of alpha and has been given a full release. This talk will address the motivations behind TensorFlow 2 and how it fixes some of the pain points of its predecessor. I will also include a practical example of how to effectively develop deep learning models using some of TensorFlow 2's features.<\/p> <p>ABOUT THE SPEAKER<br/>Elliott is a Data Scientist at BlackSky inc., a Virginia Based Geospatial company. For the past 5 years he has worked on developing and productizing several aspects of machine learning, particularly in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing. He is always interested in what is making an impact in the world of understanding data.<\/p> <p>Outside of work he attends several local DC meetups and loves to engage with and learn from others in the field.<\/p> ",

El análisis de los sistemas ecológicos como redes ha desempeñado un papel central en el desarrollo de la ecología como ciencia. Las redes se pueden agrupar en tres clases, en función de los tipos de organismos e interacciones involucradas: redes tróficas, redes hospedero-parasitoide y redes mutualistas. Las redes mutualistas comprenden las interacciones que son beneficiosas para ambas partes (por ejemplo, redes planta-polinizador y planta-dispersor). Las interacciones han tenido un papel central en la evolución de la biodiversidad terrestre y son el sostén de la diversidad y el funcionamiento de las comunidades naturales.<br/>En los últimos años estás herramientas han pasado de ser investigación pura a investigación aplicada, por ejemplo, se han aplicado en el contexto de la restauración del hábitats, el estudio de invasiones de especies exóticas, el manejo del pastoreo, el control biológico de plagas, la conservación de especies, entre muchas otras.<\/p> <p>:: PÚBLICO ::<br/>El espacio es limitado, por lo que les agradecemos su comprensión.

    "description": "<p>Join us in welcoming Martin John Hadley (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinjhnhadley\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/martinjhnhadley<\/a> pronouns they/them) for an interactive workshop on htmlwidgets, Shiny, and reproducibility!<\/p> <p>Data visualisation is an incredible tool for exploring, understanding and communicating the stories behind datasets. You might know about how to create static dataviz with R and ggplot2, but there's a whole zoo of htmlwidgets for creating interactive charts, maps, networks and more without learning any JavaScript. Add Shiny to the mix and you can create interactive web applications completely in R.<\/p> <p>But something we often leave out of this conversation is how to make data truly accessible and reproducibly available for the future. Martin will tie together interactive dataviz, Shiny and their work at our R-Ladies Meetup to support an end-to-end reproducible Open Data workflow.<\/p> <p>• About Martin: Martin started learning R on May 29th 2015 to prepare for their role in IT Services at University of Oxford where they lucked out on internal funding to setup the \"Interactive Data Network\" (idn.it.ox.ac.uk), which supports Oxford researchers in creating interactive dataviz of Open Data using Shiny and htmlwidgets. Since founding the IDN, Martin has created several R training courses for LinkedIn Learning and as of 2019 is a full time freelance R consultant and trainer - they're also a die hard reproducible research evangelist.<\/p> <p>• Installation requirements:<br/>Please have the following installed on your computer before this workshop (or come early and we'll help you with installation):<br/>- R<br/>- RStudio<\/p> <p>Run the following command in the R console to make sure you have the appropriate packages installed:<\/p> <p>install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"leaflet\", \"highcharter\", \"rmarkdown\", \"shiny\", \"fivethirtyeight\", \"sf\", \"rnaturalearthdata\")<\/p> <p>• Schedule<br/>5:45-6 -- Installation help, R Tour (please come early for help getting set up with R if you need it!)<br/>6-6:30 -- Food and drinks, Intros &amp; Announcements<br/>6:30-7:30 -- Workshop by Martin<br/>7:30-8:00-- Socializing/Networking/Hanging out/Chillin'<\/p> <p>Q: Are men welcome to attend this event?<br/>A: Our primary mission is to encourage more women and non-binary individuals to get involved in the R community. ***As such, we strongly encourage that all men who attend this event have a female or non-binary sponsor. Please contact [masked] if you have questions.***<\/p> <p>Additionally, please help us by spreading the word about R-Ladies, and by being respectful of the fact that this event is primarily for women/non-binary/female-identifying individuals.<\/p> <p>• What to bring<br/>Yourself! And a laptop - this will be an interactive event.<\/p> <p>• Important to know<br/>We expect all attendees to abide &amp; be governed by our community code of conduct.

During the meeting attendees have the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the content of the book with the session host and each other. If the book includes exercises the meeting offers the opportunity to compare each others answers and work on more difficult problems together.<\/p> <p>The first book we will work through is the R for Data Science book (available online: <a href=\"https://r4ds.had.co.nz/\" class=\"linkified\">https://r4ds.had.co.nz/<\/a> ), each fortnight we will discuss one of the sections: Explore, Wrangle, Program, Model, Communicate<\/p> <p>In this meetup we are looking at two sections, Section III - Program and Section IV - Model.<\/p> <p>We will look at using the pipe, writing functions, and iterating over a data structure to automate our workflow. This sections also covers vectors in more detail; vectors are the fundamental building block of more complex data structures.<\/p> <p>\"All models are wrong, but some are useful.\" - George Box<br/>This section looks fitting models to better understand your data and builds on top of the exploratory data analysis tools looked at in the previous sections.<\/p> <p>Location - we are meeting at the Curtin University Law School, 57 Murray Street. Someone will be waiting by the entrance to let you in and point you to the right room. If possible please arrive by 5.45pm.<\/p> <p>If this format is successful, future books could include:<br/>1.

She has a PhD in applied econometrics, recently graduated from Copenhagen Business School, and is now working as a part-time researcher at China-Europe Productivity Center.<\/p> <p>Shihan's presentation is about advanced regression frameworks on decomposition techniques to analyze reasons for customer retention. Shihan will show one of her PhD projects - the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and decomposition based on conditional quantiles(non-linear), performed on individual-level data from Statistic Denmark. Principal component analysis (PCA) will also be briefly discussed at the end of the presentation.<\/p> <p>SECOND TALK:<br/>Our second speaker is Peer Christensen, who has a backround in linguistics and cognitive science. While working towards a PhD, he became interested in pursuing a career as a data scientist and spent much time learning R and Python. Peer recently started working at Saxo.com where he finds new ways of leveraging customer and product data to create insights.<\/p> <p>Predicting customer churn is a special case of binary classification, where standard measures of predictive accuracy are misleading when true positive predictions (churn = yes) are more important than true negatives (churn = no).<\/p> <p>Peer will show some of his ongoing work using R and the H2O autoML framework to train and evaluate multiple models in terms of their usefulness in a real-world use case.<\/p> <p>SAVE THE DATE!:<br/>When: December 5<br/>Time: 17:30 - 19:30<br/>Where: Niels Brock<br/>Bispetorvet 3<br/>1167 Copenhagen<\/p> <p>See you all soon!<\/p> <p>Regards,<br/>RLadies CPH<br/>Ivana, Shihan, Peer, Sharon<\/p> ",

As with the first meetup, we'll be hosting two speakers to give us some insight into their work in R, and this time we'll also trial a five-minute \"agony aunt\" session at the end- if anyone has come up against a brick wall with a problem they're trying to solve this is your chance to put that to the group (which may in itself prove therapeutic). If you'd like a guaranteed one-minute slot email one of the organisers, if there's time we'll also welcome on-the-night queries. Now, to our two speakers!:<\/p> <p>Mirjam Allik will be presenting her work “Writing R functions: changing existing functions to get what you want\". While there is a function for almost anything in R, at times the behaviour of these is not exactly what you would wish. Rather than writing a completely new function tailored to your needs, it is sometimes possible to edit or “be inspired” by the source code of another function performing similar tasks. We will look at the useful function na.locf (last observation carried over) from the zoo package and see how this can be altered to infer missing values.<\/p> <p>Nicola McGuire will be delivering a presentation on \"Conducting meta analysis in R using individual participant level data\". Nicola is a 3rd year PhD student investigating the relationship between negative symptoms (difficulties with motivation, social engagement experiencing pleasure, and displaying emotions), and metacognition - our ability to understand ourselves and the world around us. She will discuss how she conducted a meta-analysis in R of existing data investigating the relationship between these two constructs and the additional benefits and possibilities realised by obtaining unique participant data from these studies. Nicola will also discuss some of the challenges in completing a meta-analysis and lessons learned. On twitter as: @nicolamcguire_.<\/p> <p>Come along to hear our two speakers and air any R woes. Afterwards we'll head to the Howlin' Wolf for post-meetup catchup!<\/p> <p>Please arrive between 1715 and 1730, there will be a rep at the main entrance where you sign in, and one on the top floor to let you in the Unit. Due to the security at the building we can't guarantee anyone arriving after 1730 will be able to gain access to the meetup, but if you're running late message Fiona Christie.<\/p> ",

This dataset will come from an article with an interesting plot. Our goal is to take a look at the raw data, and generate either a copy of the original plot or a novel take on the data! You can obviously use whatever techniques you feel are appropriate, but the data will be organized in a way that tidyverse tools will work well!<\/p> <p>We will come together and work in teams helping each other solve this weeks TidyTuesday challenge. TidyTuesdays are a great way to improve R skills and get involved in the community!<\/p> <p>* To participate in TidyTuesday, you need to do a few things *<\/p> <p>Create and save an image of a plot from R<br/>- Save the code used to recreate your plot (include data tidy steps!)<br/>- Submit the plot and code on Twitter<br/>- Use the #TidyTuesday hashtag (you can also tag me @thomas_mock)<br/>- Browse other submissions and like/comment on their work!<\/p> <p>However, that might seem like a lot! So at minimum please submit your plot with the hashtag #TidyTuesday.<\/p> <p>* Rules for TidyTuesday *<\/p> <p>We welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts to participate, but be mindful of a few things:<\/p> <p>- This is NOT about criticizing the original authors. They are people like you and me and they have feelings. Focus on the data, the charts and improving your own techniques.<br/>- This is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow #RStats practitioners! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like other’s posts and help promote the #RStats community!<br/>- The data set comes from the source article or the source that the article credits. Be mindful that the data is what it is and Tidy Tuesday is designed to help you practice data visualization and basic data wrangling.<br/>- Use the hashtag #TidyTuesday on Twitter if you create your own version and would like to share it.<br/>- Include a picture of the visualisation when you post to Twitter.<br/>- Include a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to Twitter. Comment your code wherever possible to help yourself and others understand your process!<br/>- Focus on improving your craft, even if you end up with someting simple! - Make something quick, but purposeful!<br/>- Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.<\/p> ",

It is apparent to anyone who has ever worked on a machine learning project that in order to realise a wide spread acceptance delivering a high accuracy model is not enough. Stakeholders are demanding transparency in how and why an algorithm is making specific predictions. A variety of approaches can be used to shed light on how algorithms make their decision: from creating alternative and more transparent algorithms that can compete with the black-box one to using robust statistical techniques. During this talk we will explore different methods for unboxing the black-box model, their pros and cons and how I have used them in TripActions.<br/>We will cover the following topics:<br/>1. Importance of human interpretable machine learning and criteria for model interpretation methods.<br/>2. Challenges and limitations of traditional techniques for model interpretation<br/>3. Hands-on example on the latest model interpretation frameworks on a supervised learning example.

So join us from 6.00pm in Old College, Usha Kasera Lecture Theatre. As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome. After the talks we’ll be heading off to a pub nearby, so do come along!<\/p> <p>Our speaker is Riinu Ots, a data scientist with an interdisciplinary background, who works as Senior Data Manager at the Centre for Medical Informatics, within The University of Edinburgh. She will be discussing:<\/p> <p># R Markdown – from RStudio to Word/PDF/website with a single push of a button<\/p> <p>In this talk, I will demonstrate 2 things:<br/>* What is Markdown and how to get directly from R into Word documents, PDF reports, websites, or presentations<br/>* How to work with R Notebooks (twin sister of R Markdown) – an interactive alternative to R scripts<br/>This talk is suitable for R newbies: working examples will be provided. Experienced users will also benefit as I’ll point out the most up to date functionality within R Markdown and RStudio.<\/p> <p>In the second part of the meeting, we’ll try something new. Since this is the final EdinbR meeting in 2019, we thought we’d close things off with a fun R quiz. There will be a prize for the winner at the end (the second edition of Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R book), so be sure to come along!<\/p> <p>If you’d like to lend a hand with creating some interesting R quiz questions, you can share your details and ideas here: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/8W8CPybWoVaAmLmJ9\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/8W8CPybWoVaAmLmJ9<\/a> or let us know at [masked].<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>The study of financial markets has attracted some of the brightest mathematicians, statisticians and psychologists over the past decades. Statistical methods to forecast returns, risk and build portfolios have been heavily researched, implemented and used within that industry. Equally, the technical pitfalls of these methods have been shown from identification vs forecasting to causation vs correlation, and transparency vs complexity of models.<\/p> <p>I will explore some of the major elements of quant (Data Science) used in finance, and their potential applications and lessons for other industries, specifically industry and government profiling citizens for loans, insurance and potential criminal activity. Focusing specifically on how these models function, their explainability, their tilts (eg ‘bias’ that has been talked about), and how misunderstood they can be in a social-contract context.<\/p> <p>Dr Michael G. Kollo<\/p> <p>Mike is an investment executive, a writer, a speaker and a self-confessed ‘translator’ for technical topics to wider audiences. Michael gained his PhD in Finance from the London School of Economics (LSE) in the UK, before joining a suite of sophisticated institutional asset managers (Blackrock, Fidelity and Axa) where he led research teams and spoke globally on applying quantitative (data science) techniques in asset management, machine learning and AI in society, the future of work and applications of alternative data. More recently, Michael moved back to Australia, joining the super industry as a leader in quantitative finance, and establishing the quantitative team for HESTA ($50bn fund). Michael continued to keep touch with academia, holding the Chief Examiner for Corporate Finance title at LSE for a decade, and teaching Masters of Finance courses at Imperial College (rated as the top lecturer), and NYU. He is a published author in the application of machine learning to investing, a contributor to WEF AI / Fintech panel, and a highly respected member of the quantitative community in both the UK and Australia. More recently, he started his own consultancy focusing on application of AI in financial services, as well as a global podcast (The Curious Quant) with a focus on the wider implications of AI in society. Michael enjoys good intellectual banter, philosophy, psychology and mixed martial arts.<\/p> <p>Come grab some pizza, mingle with the illuminati of the Canberra Data Science community, and hear a fantastic talk!<\/p> ",

But is this ideal? How can we teach/learn/internalize ggplot and maybe get away from this copy/paste approach? Using some “slow ggplot” principles might help. The approach emphasizes incrementalism, clarity, and aesthetic mapping; and it deemphasizes geoms. While verbose and a little unorthodox, slow ggplotting might assist more users unlock the power of ggplot2. A short demo using this approach will be part of the talk.

    "description": "<p>On Tuesday, December 3rd at 6 pm, the wonderful Jaky Kueper will be enlightening us on how to go on a data adventure.<\/p> <p>Jaky has taken us through a cleaning and exploration workshop before, and she’s awesome! Come and join us to learn some common practices and procedures for data cleaning and exploration — how to get data into a ‘usable’ form and start looking at what they can tell you. We will touch on working with multiple datasets (joins) and strategies for when you need to learn more about your data or where they come from. This workshop is appropriate for all skill levels!<\/p> <p>There will be time for the group to skill-share and practice/troubleshoot; if you have new data that you are or will be working with this summer, bring it! Important to remember is that we are back at our home at the London Public Library Central Branch! We’ll be in the Stevenson and Hunt A Room - we’ll have signs! Parking is free if you park in the Citi Plaza lot - entrance on King. Bring your parking pass to the library’s main service desk and tell them you’re with R-Ladies to get your parking validated.<\/p> <p>London Public Library - Central 251 Dundas St London, Ontario Canada N6A 6H9<\/p> <p>After we’ve filled our heads with cleaning and exploration knowledge, we’ll explore our way right over to our favourite Milos’ for great beer and better company. See you all very soon!<\/p> ",

When we have access to dynamic, longitudinal, continuously updating data, that complexity can become an asset. We will demonstrate how to to simplify data quality monitoring of dynamic data with a functional programming approach that enables early and actionable detection of data quality concerns. Using `purrr` as well as `tidyr` and nested tibbles, we will illustrate the five key pillars of enjoyable, user-friendly data quality monitoring with relevant R code: Readability, Reproducibility, Efficiency, Robustness, and Compositionality.<\/p> <p>Speaker 1: Jacqueline Gutman is a data scientist on the Quantitative Sciences team at Flatiron Health, supporting cancer research and improving patient care by working with electronic health record data and building accessible data science tools for reproducible research.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Survival analysis for everyone!<br/>When people initially think of survival analysis, they usually think of terminal diseases and mortality. But it had much broader applications in the medical field. I'll be giving a brief overview of survival analysis, it's applications in a behavioral health managed care setting, and some tips on communicating these results to clinical teams.<\/p> <p>Speaker 2: Jessica Streeter is a Data Scientist at Spring Health, and a medical sociologist turned data scientist. She has spent her career working in the behavioral health space, including in direct care at an inpatient psychiatrist hospital.<\/p> <p>Talk 3: Hierarchical Models for Survival Analysis with Spatial Risk Factors in R<br/>Observations within a community are more likely to be correlated than those from different communities. Hierarchical models with random effects are often built to account for such correlation. In this talk, I will focus on spatial hierarchical models in the context of survival data. I will review survival model with random frailties, to account for clustering within a community, and its extension to account for autocorrelation between frailties of neighboring communities.<\/p> <p>Speaker 3: Sam Adhikari an assistant professor of Biostatistics in the Department of Population Health, NYU School of Medicine. Her research interest lies in developing and implementing statistical and machine learning tools to solve problems motivated by real world applications in medicine, global health and education.<\/p> ",

The package includes facilities for:<\/p> <p>* Calling Python from R in a variety of ways including R Markdown, sourcing Python scripts, importing Python modules, and using Python interactively within an R session.<\/p> <p>* Translation between R and Python objects (for example, between R and Pandas data frames, or between R matrices and NumPy arrays).<\/p> <p>* Flexible binding to different versions of Python including virtual environments and Conda environments.<\/p> <p>Reticulate embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling seamless, high-performance interoperability. If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, reticulate can dramatically streamline your workflow!<\/p> <p>Come early, network and enjoy the food.

    "description": "<p>Na naszym drugim już spotkaniu w ramach WAMPIRa (Wrocławski Alians Miłośników Pythona i R) możecie dowiedzieć się co to jest SVI oraz jak radzić sobie z brakującymi danymi w R.<\/p> <p>Spotkania z cyklu WAMPIR przeznaczone są dla bardziej zaawansowanych miłośników data science, którzy chcą pogłębić swoją wiedzę z zakresu szybko rozwijających się technologii. Będzie technicznie, będzie dogłębnie, ale zawsze w przyjaznej STWURowej atmosferze.<\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>Wprowadzenie do Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI):<\/p> <p>Modele Bayesowskie są bardzo interesującą propozycją, m.in. dlatego, że rezultatem ich działania<br/>jest rozkład prawdpodobnieństwa, a nie punktowa estymacja.<br/>Niestety bardzo często uczenie i wnioskowanie w tych modelach jest bardzo kosztowne obliczeniowo.<br/>Problem nasila się wraz ze złożonością modelu i ilością danych.<br/>W prezentacji zaczniemy od szybkiego wprowadzenia do probabilistycznych modeli graficznych.<br/>Następnie pokazana zostanie trudność infernecji i sposoby aproksymacji.<br/>Praktyczne przykłady regresji i clusteringu zostaną pokazne przy użyciu biblioteki pyro.ai, która bazuje na popularnym PyTorchu.<\/p> <p>A missing values tour in R -- with a special focus on parameter estimation:<\/p> <p>Imagine you are solving a linear regression but there are a lot of missing values in your design matrix, how can you deal with so many \"NA\"? The trouble may be caused by survey non-responses, lost records or machine failures.<br/>Classical packages performing estimation would let you ignore all the lines with missingness, as a result, much information would be lost. A more reasonable method to handle this problem, is modifying an estimation process so that the method can be applied to incomplete data. For example, one can use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood estimate despite missing values.<br/>Another popular choice is imputation, followed by classical regression procedure on imputed dataset. In this presentation, I will talk about different types of missing data, review several imputation methods and demonstrate how to estimate parameters based on EM algorithm with R.<\/p> <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Bio naszych prelengentów:<\/p> <p>Michał Kurtys jest Data Scientistem pracującym w firmie Infermedica.

However, it is worth to come regardless of your R level, surely you will find something for yourself!<br/>The last part of the meeting will be the networking session with pizza, there will be a chance to get to know each other better and exchange experiences.<\/p> <p>Plan:<br/>18:15 - 19:45 - ggplot2 workshop<br/>20:00 - 20:30 - Statistical inference with missing values, Wei Jiang<br/>20:30 - ... - pizza<\/p> <p>ggplot2 workshops registration (in Polish):<br/><a href=\"https://forms.gle/Aj6xZkXoJ8WeguoV8\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/Aj6xZkXoJ8WeguoV8<\/a><br/>Workshops are open to everyone, but we would like to ask you to fill in the form.<br/>This will help us to adjust the advancement level of the workshops and divide participants into groups with a similar level of R knowledge. In addition, we will be able to send further details, such as room numbers or links to materials to your e-mail.<\/p> <p># Statistical inference with missing values<br/>Description:<br/>Missing data exist in almost all areas of empirical research. There are various reasons why missing data may occur, including survey non-response, unavailability of measurements, and lost data. In this presentation, I will first share my experience on how to do parametric estimation with missing covariates, based on likelihood methods and Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Then I will focus on recent results of variable selection in high-dimensional settings with missing observations among the covariates. To address this relatively understudied problem, we propose a new synergistic procedure – adaptive Bayesian SLOPE – which effectively combines the SLOPE method (sorted l1 regularization) together with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO method. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of power, FDR and estimation bias under a wide range of scenarios. Finally, we analyze a real dataset consisting of patients from Paris hospitals who underwent a severe trauma, where we show excellent performance in predicting platelet levels.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Wei Jiang is currently pursuing PhD degree in Statistics at Ecole Polytechnique, France. Her research mainly focuses on statistical inference with missing values and applications on medical dataset. Fan of R, eager to learn more about data science and mathematics.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Abstract: In a multimodal virtual environment (VE) that incorporates a number of senses, i.e., visual, auditory, and touch or haptic, data can be made tangible along with its visual presentation. Variables can be represented as haptic glyphs of different shapes, sizes, and other physical properties such as friction. Audio feedback helps further exploration of the data. However, an effective mapping across different modalities is a challenging task; what is visually accessible by sighted people, may cause information overload if being accessed via touch by the blind or visually impaired (VI). While working on different modalities, equivalent design continues to be emphasized. This pilot study addresses challenges associated with the use of glyphs in multivariate data presentations and identifies the optimum multimodal platform. The result of this pilot study demonstrates that glyphs can be successfully used for presenting multivariate data in a multimodal VE. This glyph-based multimodal presentation makes information available to the blind and VI in a semantic-aware environment. A multimodal VE also enriches the experience of the sighted users.<\/p> <p>Profile of Speaker: Shamima Yasmin, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Eastern Washington University.

One way to address this issue is to use a geo experiment: a quasi-experiment that measures the causal impact of a marketing intervention. It's similar to an A/B test but instead of assigning individuals randomly to control and treatment groups, geographic regions are used to define the groups. I will give an introduction on how we use geo experiments at trivago to test the effectiveness of our marketing investments and explain how the tests are set up and analyzed in R.<\/p> <p>My Loan Tong is a data analyst at trivago.

Monmonier shows that, despite their immense value, maps lie. In fact, they must.<\/p> <p>The second edition is updated with the addition of two new chapters, 10 color plates, and a new foreword by renowned geographer H. J. de Blij. One new chapter examines the role of national interest and cultural values in national mapping organizations, including the United States Geological Survey, while the other explores the new breed of multimedia, computer-based maps.<\/p> <p>To show how maps distort, Monmonier introduces basic principles of mapmaking, gives entertaining examples of the misuse of maps in situations from zoning disputes to census reports, and covers all the typical kinds of distortions from deliberate oversimplifications to the misleading use of color.<\/p> <p>\"Professor Monmonier himself knows how to gain our attention; it is not in fact the lies in maps but their truth, if always approximate and incomplete, that he wants us to admire and use, even to draw for ourselves on the facile screen. His is an artful and funny book, which like any good map, packs plenty in little space.\"—Scientific American<\/p> <p>\"A useful guide to a subject most people probably take too much for granted. It shows how map makers translate abstract data into eye-catching cartograms, as they are called. It combats cartographic illiteracy. It fights cartophobia. It may even teach you to find your way. For that alone, it seems worthwhile.\"—Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, The New York Times<\/p> <p>\". . . witty examination of how and why maps lie. [The book] conveys an important message about how statistics of any kind can be manipulated. But it also communicates much of the challenge, aesthetic appeal, and sheer fun of maps. Even those who hated geography in grammar school might well find a new enthusiasm for the subject after reading Monmonier's lively and surprising book.\"—Wilson Library Bulletin<\/p> <p>\"A reading of this book will leave you much better defended against cheap atlases, shoddy journalism, unscrupulous advertisers, predatory special-interest groups, and others who may use or abuse maps at your expense.\"—John Van Pelt, Christian Science Monitor<\/p> <p>\"Monmonier meets his goal admirably. . . . [His] book should be put on every map user's 'must read' list. It is informative and readable . . . a big step forward in helping us to understand how maps can mislead their readers.\"—Jeffrey S.

The first part of this talk will cover the process I took to create the animations in R, mainly focusing on the gganimate R package but covering other supplementary tidyverse functions. The second part of this talk will be on the knowledge gained from these animations, most of which confirm our intuition about basketball. Hopefully, after this talk, I inspire the audience to go out and look for interesting data to work on.<\/p> <p>Enhance your Shiny applications with interactive charts, tables, maps and more! - Bethany Yollin:<\/p> <p>This presentation will highlight several R libraries that enable Shiny developers to leverage the power of Javascript--no web development experience required.<br/>The presentation will be accompanied by live demos and fully-reproducible code that can be repurposed for your data visualization needs. Concepts from this presentation will come together to create a Seattle collisions dashboard to monitor pedestrian safety.<\/p> ",

Hence, there is often a conflict between accuracy and interpretability. We want the most accurate models but don’t want to sacrifice interpretability. In this talk, I discuss this conflict and some new methods in Machine Learning for interpreting ANY predictive model so you do not have to sacrifice predictive accuracy. A package (<a href=\"https://github.com/mt-edwards/xrayspecs\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/mt-edwards/xrayspecs<\/a>) is also introduced that provides these new methods for R programmers.<\/p> ",
