Its interface is designed to be both straightforward yet powerful. There are simple functions for those everyday display table needs but also plenty of options for customizability should you need it.<\/p> <p>There is a defined table model that subdivides a table into its component parts. These include the table header, the stub, the column labels and spanner column labels, the table body, and the table footer. All of these parts (and their component cells) can be targeted for the application of styling or the addition of footnotes. With all of the available options, there are many ways to customize the look of your table.<\/p> <p>The best way to get a feel for what gt can do is to take it for a spin, and so we’ll do that through some live demos. I’ll walk you though some code that progressively adds components to a gt table. Table cells will be formatted and, through styling, their appearance will be radically changed. The result in each case will be an HTML table that can be used in a variety of data products.<\/p> <p>**Talk2** (25min talk, 5min Q&amp;A)<br/>Speaker: Avik Das, Software Engineer at LinkedIn<br/>Title: Dynamic programming for machine learning: Hidden Markov Models<br/>Abstract: A Hidden Markov Model deals with inferring the state of a system given some unreliable or ambiguous observations from that system. One important characteristic of this system is the state of the system evolves over time, producing a sequence of observations along the way. By incorporating some domain-specific knowledge, it’s possible to take the observations and work backwards to a maximally plausible ground truth.<\/p> <p>This talk explores Hidden Markov Models in three steps:<\/p> <p>First, I define Hidden Markov Models and how they apply to machine learning problems.<\/p> <p>Next, I build up an understanding of the Viterbi algorithm, used to infer the state of the system given a sequence of observations. This involves some basic math, but the goal is to form an intuition for the algorithm. Some sample Python code is presented to demonstrate how simple the algorithm is.<\/p> <p>Finally, I introduce several real-world applications of Hidden Markov Models in machine learning. In this section, real-world considerations like feature extraction and training are discussed.<\/p> <p>Basic math knowledge is expected, just the ability to express concepts as equations and an understanding of Big-O notation. Basic Python knowledge is helpful, but not required. The goal is build up intuition.<\/p> <p>**Code of Conduct**: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>**Schedule**<br/>6:15 open zoom<br/>6:30-7:00 First talk<br/>7:00-7:30 Second talk<br/>~8:00 Virtual Social<\/p> <p>**LA R Users Group**<br/>Invite yourself to our Slack group: <a href=\"https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/<\/a><br/>Ask us any questions by email: [masked]<br/>Find our previous talks on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/presentations\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/presentations<\/a><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @la_Rusers<br/>Check out more events: <a href=\"https://laocr.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://laocr.org/<\/a><\/p> <p>***** DON'T BE SHY *******<br/>Reach out if you want to be our speaker.

Only by knowing, who your clients are, you can truly maximize ROI on your marketing campaigns. You will need the profit-driven analytics to help you segment your clients into those segments. Unfortunately, classical Machine Learning (ML) cannot distinguish between those segments. As a result, traditional Machine Learning cannot fully maximize ROI, leaving money on the table. Since, ML models are deployed commonly in banking, telco, retail, etc., it creates the opportunity to improve on that. How? Through making the analytics more profit-driven and employing the most recent &amp; state-of-the-art analytical methods from the intersection of machine learning, causal inference, uplift modelling and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, e.g. Causal Forrest, Generalized Random Forrest, meta-learners, Qini curve, Area under Qini, see Athey, et al. (2019), Chen, et al. (2020), Taddy (2019).<br/>In the presentation, we will demonstrate the example of marketing campaign and show, how we should properly calculate the true profit, i.e. uplift, from our analytical models. We'll present the segmentation of clients into sleeping dogs, sure buyers, lost causes, necessary for ROI maximization. Finally, we will show snippets of R &amp; Python codes implementing these techniques.<\/p> <p>Abstracts<\/p> <p>Mateusz Zawisza - Senior Analytics Advisor to McKinsey &amp; Company<br/>Senior Analytics Advisor to McKinsey &amp; Company with over 10 years of experience in designing &amp; implementing advanced analytics solutions for retail, telecommunication, banking and public sector in Poland and abroad.

It provides an expressive and intuitive language to define ML workflows as directed acyclic graphs that represent data flows between computational units, e.g., data preprocessing and model fitting. Many complex ML concepts for which special purpose packages are usually provided can now be expressed in few lines of graph definition code, e.g. unions of feature views, bagging, stacking and hurdle models. Resulting pipelines are parameterized, so all components can be jointly tuned to obtain an optimal configuration.<br/>Graphs can contain \"branching\" nodes which allows selective, conditional processing of execution paths. The tuning of such tasks makes complex model selection possible.<br/>The modular, object-oriented concept of mlr3pipelines facilitates convenient extension with custom operations, while the compatibility with mlr3 allows convenient tuning, benchmarking, nested resampling and more.<\/p> <p>This leads to the possibility of specifying custom, minimal automatic machine learning systems by constructing and tuning pipelines that can be adjusted for a respective task.<\/p> <p>Project page: <a href=\"https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3pipelines<\/a><\/p> ",

In this talk, understand word embeddings by investigating how we can generate them using count-based statistics and dimensionality reduction, then learn how to make use of pre-trained embeddings based on enormous datasets. Finally, explore the ethical issues involved in using word embeddings and how they can amplify systemic and historical bias.<\/p> <p>Bio: Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC (<a href=\"https://rstudio.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.com/<\/a>) where she works on open source modeling tools.

    "description": "<p>Python lunch break with Boston useR / Model Management in Python<\/p> <p>Whether your primary language is R or Python, one of the biggest frustrations of a data scientist is to have your hard work go underutilized. To combat this, we have seen data scientists create more interactive content (such as applications, APIs, and dashboards) to engage the divided attention of stakeholders. While we may be more familiar with this story for R, how can we also do this with Python? The most common open-source tools for exploring data, building web applications, and building interactive visualizations in Python are Jupyter Notebooks, Flask, and Dash. We'll show you how to build end-to-end workflows for model management using these open-source tools. Additionally, RStudio's enterprise tools can optionally be used when you're ready to host these tools in production and share them within a team.<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Kristopher Overholt is a solutions engineer at RStudio who works with enterprise data science products and operational data science workflows. Kristopher is a proud Texan and fan of R, Python, and DevOps.<\/p> <p>Topics covered:<br/>Python AND R, not Python vs. R<br/>Python in the RStudio IDE<br/>Python+R with reticulate<br/>Jupyter Notebooks in RStudio<br/>Publishing/scheduling Jupyter Notebooks<br/>Publishing Flask/Dash applications<\/p> ",

However, many types of data don't fall into either of these two categories. In this session, we will review regression techniques that can handle other kinds of inputs: censored normal, logit-normal, and beta regression (for dependent variables that are bounded above and/or below); ordered logistic regression (for multiple discrete outcomes that are logically ordered, such as Likert ratings); and multinomial logistic regression (for discrete outcomes that aren't ordered). These techniques provide a better representation of the processes they are modeling and allow us to make more realistic predictions.<\/p> <p>Abby Kaplan is a data scientist at Salt Lake Community College.

    "description": "<p>When working with data, we often want to create models to predict future events, but we also want an even deeper understanding of how our data is causally connected or structured. In this workshop, we will explore the connectedness of data using structural equation modeling (SEM) with the {lavaan} package.<\/p> <p>If you want to actively follow the workshop, please have the R packages {lavaan} and {semPlot} installed. Because of the virtual format of the workshop, we will only have very limited capacities for helping with troubleshooting.<\/p> <p>The speaker, Ronny Scherer, received his PhD from Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in 2012, and is currently working at the Centre for Educational Measurement, University of Oslo (CEMO). His research and teaching cover structural equation modeling, meta-analysis, computer-based assessments, and multilevel analysis. Ronny is coordinating the Measurement Models course at CEMO.<\/p> <p>We look forward seeing all of you!<\/p> <p>Update:<\/p> <p>The packages used during the workshop is lavaan, semPlot, MPsychoR and corrplot.

    "description": "<p>The machine learning package caret (Classification And REgression Training) contains functions to streamline the model training process for complex regression and classification problems. There are many different modeling functions in R, and the various algorithms have different syntax, different parameters to tune and different requirements on the data format. Caret provides a uniform interface for more than 230 different machine learning models without loading them all at start. In addition, it standardizes various other tasks such as data splitting, pre-processing, feature selection, variable importance estimation, resampling, model comparison, parallel processing, and visualization, etc. It may take some time to get up to speed with caret, but hopefully this presentation will ease the transition. Caret is all you need to know to solve almost any supervised machine learning problem!<\/p> <p>Silje is currently working as a Data Scientist at Amesto Nextbridge, and has over 15 years of experience in large scale data analysis.

    "description": "<p>Ciencia de Datos aplicada al desarrollo de AgTech<\/p> <p>El sector agropecuario y agroindustrial tiene el gran desafío de satisfacer las demandas de un mundo con mayor necesidad de alimentos que se produzcan cuidando la salud, el ambiente y los recursos naturales. Este objetivo de producir más y mejor, con los mismos o menos recursos, se puede abordar desde dos ópticas: por un lado, el desarrollo y masificación de máquinas precisas y por el otro, el aumento en el uso y explotación de datos e información que ya se generan (o generarán en el futuro cercano) para mejorar la toma de decisiones en el manejo agropecuario. Enmarcada en esta segunda línea, la ciencia de datos tiene mucho que aportar y en esta charla se presentarán una serie de aplicaciones que llevo adelante con mi grupo de trabajo y las herramientas que usamos para desarrollarlas.<\/p> <p>Sobre la expositora:<\/p> <p>\"Soy investigadora en INTA (Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agrícola) y me dedico a aplicar la ciencia de datos al sector agropecuario. Trabajo en una Estación Experimental Agropecuaria, por lo que mis desarrollos y soluciones están relacionados con la realidad productiva de la provincia de La Pampa, donde vivo con mi esposo y mis dos hermosos hijos.<br/>Disfruto mucho enseñando, así que paso parte de mi tiempo impartiendo cursos y escribiendo material de enseñanza sobre mis temas de investigación. Soy cofundadora de MetaDocencia, una organización educativa abierta, gratuita, dirigida por voluntarios y sin fines de lucro. Desde 2019 soy RStudio Certified Trainer.<br/>Además, soy muy activa en la Comunidad R: formo parte del Equipo Global de R-Ladies y soy fundadora y organizadora del Capítulo de R-Ladies Santa Rosa. Soy cofundadora y presidenta de LatinR y formé parte del equipo que tradujo diversos materiales de R al español (ej: R para Ciencia de Datos, RStudio Cheat Sheets).<br/>Relaciono mi trabajo en INTA con mi trabajo en la Comunidad R buscando hacer que mi ciencia sea lo más reproducible y abierta posible utilizando software libre. Soy presidenta, desde 2016, del Congreso Argentino de Agroinformática (CAI) y presidenta general en 2020 de las Jornadas Argentinas de Informática e Investigación Operativa (JAIIO)\"<\/p> <p>No puedes perderte esta charla !<br/>Te esperamos ! :)<\/p> ",

She received a B.S. from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2016. Her research focuses on how people's social beliefs and expectations impact behaviors. Specifically, she is interested in how people perceive what is typical or desirable in a social group, how people make inferences of social information, and how individual differences in these inferences impact judgments and decision makings. She hopes these findings could inform intervention design to nudge people do good. Jinyi is currently working with CSNBD to assess social determinants of sanitation behaviors in India. She will present her recent research and how she uses R for her research workflow.<\/p> <p>Tess Cherlin is a PhD student at Thomas Jefferson University in the Genetics, Genomics, and Cancer Biology program and does her research in the Computational Medicine Center. She uses computational and wet lab methods to study small noncoding RNA profiles in health and disease contexts. Tess had no experience with R (or coding) when she began her PhD but has found R to be very learnable and incredibly useful for her data analysis.

We are crowd sourcing these handy coding tips and tricks from our community. If you have something that you want to share please fill out the Google survey (link below). All you have to do is fill out the survey and we will make the slide; there is an example tip slide attached for reference in the survey. We would love for each submitter to give a quick explanation about their tip at next week’s meeting, but we of course are happy to present for those who do not want to or can’t. If you are unable to attend, but would still like to share that awesome shortcut you use each time you open up R, please submit! We’ll share on your behalf, and your fellow R-ladies will be appreciative!<\/p> <p>The meeting Zoom link will become available once you’ve RSVPed.<\/p> <p>Looking forward to learning something new with you all!<\/p> <p>Best,<br/>Juliette, An, &amp; Sam<\/p> <p>Google Survey Link: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/FvwKDJMRvzkL9uVq8\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/FvwKDJMRvzkL9uVq8<\/a><\/p> ",

As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two lenses of knowledge together to take us on “a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical, as clever as it is wise” (Elizabeth Gilbert).<\/p> <p>Drawing on her life as an indigenous scientist, and as a woman, Kimmerer shows how other living beings—asters and goldenrod, strawberries and squash, salamanders, algae, and sweetgrass—offer us gifts and lessons, even if we've forgotten how to hear their voices. In reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

Já trabalhei com dados de fraudes no SUS e fiz parte de um grupo de estudos de alunos da UFMG com participação voluntária (Stats4Good) em que nos dedicamos a compreender e quantificar a sub-notificação dos crimes de estupro em mulheres no Brasil, chamado GESEM. Hoje eu sou Cientista de Dados na maior plataforma de eventos do Brasil -a Sympla. Desde outubro sou colunista do radar Social Good Brasil. Eu adoro comunicar meus aprendizados (e dores, né?), desmistificando IA e me encantando no meio desse processo.<\/p> <p>A primeira vez que eu ouvi falar de word2vec fiquei encantada! Era uma mistura de Matemática com Linguística que parecia uma forma intuitiva de modelar palavras e os seus significados. A ideia é criar um embedding para uma palavra. Ou seja, representá-la como um vetor cuja dimensão é definida pelo usuário. O algoritmo concebe esse vetor aprendendo com os termos que estão em uma janela K de cada termo em análise para que a representação vetorial traduza essa concepção de contexto. E isso tudo é feito com uma rede neural simples! Os algoritmos word2vec foram um divisor de águas da literatura porque permitiram mapear relações sintáticas e semânticas entre palavras. Além da apresentação teórica, vou falar sobre como avaliar a qualidade das embeddings obtidas além de mostrar como fazê-lo - facilmente- no R. Eu tenho certeza que estudar as word embeddings é um jeito muito legal de começar a estudar Processamento de Linguagem Natural!<\/p> <p>Inscrições e transmissão via Sympla no link<br/><a href=\"https://www.sympla.com.br/3-meetup-r-ladies-lavras__872664\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.sympla.com.br/3-meetup-r-ladies-lavras__872664<\/a><\/p> ",

Their job is to follow a data science project from the early design until the end: to identify its business requirements, translate them into analytical problems and support all the parties involved in arriving towards a satisfactory solution... and on time. In this talk, we will go through the nitty-gritty of business translation and we will show how some of the tricks could benefit all of us working in data science, regardless of our role.<\/p> <p>ABSTRACT - FOCUS 2<\/p> <p>In the last decade, the complexity of predictive models has increased. This trend has favored accuracy and prediction rates at the expense of interpretability. However, the ability to correctly interpret the output is extremely important to justify future actions. Many methods have been proposed to deal with the need for understanding black boxes. SHAP is a powerful framework based on game theory that allows interpreting any machine learning model. In this talk we will first define the basic concepts of model interpretability and explainability and discuss the importance of explainable machine learning models, then we will introduce SHAP through a practical case study.<\/p> <p>Speakers:<br/>*Oriana Angelucci is a senior business translator. She worked in market research and now focused on data-driven transformation of Customer Relationship Management processes through the application of advanced analytics.<\/p> <p>*Marilena Di Bari, Ph.D. is a senior business translator. She previously worked in the fields of computational linguistics and translation, and is now involved in data-driven projects of Customer Relationship Management and Bancassurance.<\/p> <p>*Martina Dossi is a statistician and junior data scientist. She worked in the area of risk management and is now involved in text analytics-based solutions within the credit risk area.<\/p> <p>*Giulia Gavazzi is a statistician and junior data scientist. She is mainly involved in machine learning solutions within the areas of operational and credit risk and prepayment risk modelling for ALM.<\/p> <p>*Maddalena Amoruso is a partner in Prometeia. She manages the Data Science division, which aims to foster and support customers' digital transformation needs.<\/p> <p>Looking forward to e-meet you all!<\/p> ",

The [tidymodels](<a href=\"https://www.tidymodels.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tidymodels.org/<\/a>) collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, we'll focus on three specific reasons to consider using tidymodels. We will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: Julia Silge<br/>Julia is a data scientist and software engineer at [RStudio PBC](<a href=\"https://rstudio.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.com/<\/a>) where she works on open source modeling tools. She is both an international keynote speaker and a real-world practitioner focusing on data analysis and machine learning practice, and is the author of [Text Mining with R](<a href=\"https://www.tidytextmining.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.tidytextmining.com/<\/a>) with her coauthor David Robinson.

    "description": "<p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0r3VYZ0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0r3VYZ0<\/a><\/p> <p>Spark OCR is an object character recognition library that can scale natively on any Spark cluster; enables processing documents privately without uploading them to a cloud service; and most importantly, provides state-of-the-art accuracy for a variety of common use cases. A primary method of maximizing accuracy is using a set of pre-built image pre-processing transformers - for noise reduction, skew correction, object removal, automated scaling, erosion, binarization, and dilation. These transformers can be combined into OCR pipelines that effectively resolve common 'document noise' issues that reduce OCR accuracy.<\/p> <p>This webinar describes real-world OCR use cases, common accuracy issues they bring, and how to use image transformers in Spark OCR in order to resolve them at scale. Example Python code will be shared using executable notebooks that will be made publicly available.<\/p> <p>Register here: <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0r3VYZ0\" class=\"linkified\">https://hubs.ly/H0r3VYZ0<\/a><\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>About the speaker<br/>Mykola Melnyk is a senior Scala, Python, and Spark software engineer with 15 years of industry experience.

Borchers etwas über Subgroup Discovery erzählt.<br/>*Subgroup Discovery* (SD) ist eine Technik des beschreibenden und explorativen Data Minings. Es werden 'interessante' Teilmengen der Daten identifiziert, in Hinblick auf ein für die jeweilige Anwendung wichtiges Merkmal. SD ist von praktischer Relevanz für wissenschaftliche wie geschäftliche Datenanalysen und kann für Analysten wie Kunden überraschende Einblicke in die Daten liefern. Ein R Paket wird vorgestellt, das diese Methode implementiert.<\/p> <p>Natürlich freuen uns auch schon darauf euch auch bei diesem Meetup begrüßen zu dürfen. Die Zugangsdaten werden wie immer am Tag des Vortrags ab 12 Uhr hier bereitgestellt.<\/p> <p>Meeting-ID: tba<br/>Passwort: tba<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>We are staying virtual this month which allows us to once again to bring in a speaker from afar. One of the most popular talks was about Generalized Additive Models, so we are excited to have Gavin Simpson give us another dose.<\/p> <p>Due to COVID-19 there is no in-person component to this meetup and it will take place entirely online. Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Since we still can't be together for pizza, Scott's Pizza Tours is sponsoring again and offering everyone 25% off virtual tours booked by July 31. Use code NerdsLovePizza at <a href=\"https://www.scottspizzatours.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.scottspizzatours.com/<\/a> for the discount.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>A defining characteristic of ecological or environmental time series is that they are messy. They're full of holes, rarely long enough but often too big, and they have a tendency to start and stop at inconvenient times and places. On top of this, the things these time series measure are inherently complex, the result of myriad interactions and processes operating throughout the biogeosphere.<\/p> <p>In this talk I'll discuss how we use generalized additive models (GAMs) to estimate nonlinear spatio-temporal trends from these messy time series and illustrate the range of models and data types that we can handle with the mgcv and brms packages. I'll explain what modern GAMs are and how they learn from data, before moving on to demonstrate modern developments in GAMs that allow us to model entire conditional distributions rather than the usual focus on means and expectations. And as I'm a geographer, not a statistician, I plan to do this with pictures, not math.<\/p> <p>About Gavin:<\/p> <p>Gavin Simpson is a Research Scientist in the Institute of Environmental Change and Society at the University of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. He is a #fakebiologist and a #fakestatistician, but he does have two degrees in Geography from University College London in the UK, though he doesn’t make many maps.<\/p> <p>Gavin's research is broadly concerned with how ecosystems and the communities of species they support change in time and space, from seconds to millennia, from ones backyard to globally. He's been using R since before v1.0 and has developed or maintains a number of R packages, including vegan, for multivariate data analyses, and gratia, a package for working with Generalized Additive Models, which feature in much of his research.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 and we will start admitting people to the event early, details will be sent beforehand. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Marketers often use A/B testing as a tool to compare marketing treatments in a test stage and then deploy the better-performing treatment to the remainder of the consumer population. These tests have traditionally been analyzed using hypothesis testing, which Elea covered in a previous R Ladies workshop. In this workshop, Elea and Ron will explain a new approach to A/B testing that they developed called \"Test &amp; Roll\" that focuses on the profit earned during and after the test. It is based on a Bayesian decision theory and the (very technical) Test &amp; Roll paper explains why marketers should use this approach. This workshop will focus on how to Test &amp; Roll using hands-on examples in R. Elea and Ron will cover:<\/p> <p>- When you should use \"Test &amp; Roll\" versus traditional hypothesis test<br/>- How to compute the Test &amp; Roll sample size that maximizes profits<br/>- How to estimate priors from your own data to help plan your Test &amp; Roll<br/>- How to analyze a Test &amp; Roll experiment (It's easy!)<\/p> <p>All you need to participate are basic R skills; we'll explain the rest.

    "description": "<p>What a treat!<\/p> <p>An event with our beloved xaringan ninja- Dr Emi Tanaka! This event is co-organised with R-Ladies Canberra, SSA Canberra &amp; SSA NSW and promises to be full of tips and tricks for how to make impressive RMarkdown-based presentations using xaringan.<\/p> <p>Abstract: In many fields, scientific communications and publications are unimaginable without LaTeX. LaTeX, built on the TeX typesetting program, allows writing scientific documents with a markup language for structure and styling; capabilities for mathematical typesetting; ability to add cross-references and citations (though BibTeX or otherwise); and customisation through document classes, packages and macros. A particular LaTeX document class widely used for making presentation slides is Beamer. Beamer offers much of the same features as the original LaTeX in addition to special macros handy for presentation purposes and is used often by academics presenting mathematical content. Why then would we want another tool for presentation?<\/p> <p>In this tutorial talk, I will talk about the capabilities and benefits of using R Markdown to make presentation slides based on the `xaringan` R-package. If you have two monitors or an extra laptop/desktop computer, then you are encouraged to try some coding yourself as you follow along with the talk.<\/p> <p>Coding requirements: you will need to be familiar with R, have R and the xaringan &amp; tidyverse R packages installed. It is preferable that you use RStudio IDE although not required.<\/p> <p>Biography: Emi is an applied statistician whose primary interest is to develop impactful methods and tools that can be readily used by practitioners. Her research interests include mixed models and experimental designs, motivated primarily by the problems in bioinformatics and agricultural sciences. She recently joined as a lecturer at the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, Monash University. She is currently the Vice President of the Statistical Society of Australia Victoria Branch.<\/p> <p>Register in advance for this meeting:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://anu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYqcu6pqj0vG9I4fvMeFOo0OuA0URBAsSdY\" class=\"linkified\">https://anu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYqcu6pqj0vG9I4fvMeFOo0OuA0URBAsSdY<\/a><\/p> <p>After registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting.<\/p> <p>Any questions, please feel free to contact [masked] or [masked]<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hi everyone,<\/p> <p>Our June event will feature a seminar from the vice-president of the Statistical Society of Australia.<\/p> <p>Jessica will discuss two topics that she has been interested in over the past couple of years. The first topic is the development of theory and tools for the design and analysis of longitudinal cluster randomised trials, and the second topic is how to make the statistics community more welcoming and inclusive.<\/p> <p>Although individually randomised trials are the gold standard for assessing the impact of new treatments on patient outcomes, cluster randomised trials are necessary when testing the effect of healthcare provider-level changes on patient outcomes, for example the effect of a hospital-wide cleaning program on the rates of hospital-acquired infections. Longitudinal cluster randomised trials follow clusters over time, and clusters may switch between treatment groups during these trials. Cross-overs, stepped wedges and staircases are all variants of these types of cluster randomised trials, and they are being conducted with increasing frequency. However, many of the underlying statistical aspects of these designs remain under-explored. I’ll discuss some of the work my group has been doing to increase our understanding of these trials and develop less burdensome trial designs, including our development of apps using the R shiny package.<\/p> <p>In the second part of the talk, I’ll discuss the work that is being done by the Statistical Society of Australia to prevent and respond to sexual and other forms of harassment within our community, and how we can increase the representation of women in statistics.<\/p> <p>Looking forward to seeing you all!<\/p> <p>R-Ladies Melbourne<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Emi Tanaka is an applied statistician whose primary interest is to develop impactful methods and tools that can be readily used by practitioners. Her research interests include mixed models and experimental designs, motivated primarily by the problems in bioinformatics and agricultural sciences. She recently joined as a lecturer at the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, Monash University. She is currently the Vice President of the Statistical Society of Australia Victoria Branch.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, Emi takes us \"Beyond Beamer: Modern and Dynamic Presentations with R Markdown\". In many fields, scientific communications and publications are unimaginable without LaTeX. LaTeX, built on the TeX typesetting program, allows writing scientific documents with a markup language for structure and styling; capabilities for mathematical typesetting; ability to add cross-references and citations (though BibTeX or otherwise); and customisation through document classes, packages and macros. A particular LaTeX document class widely used for making presentation slides is Beamer. Beamer offers much of the same features as the original LaTeX in addition to special macros handy for presentation purposes and is used often by academics presenting mathematical content. Why then would we want another tool for presentation?<\/p> <p>In this tutorial talk, Emi will talk about the capabilities and benefits of using R Markdown to make presentation slides based on the `xaringan` R-package. If you have two monitors or an extra laptop/desktop computer, then you are encouraged to try some coding yourself as you follow along with the talk.<\/p> <p>Coding requirements: you will need to be familiar with R, have R and the xaringan &amp; tidyverse R packages installed. It is preferable that you use RStudio IDE although not required.<\/p> ",

And then she meets Bill Clinton. A handsome, charismatic southerner and fellow law student, Bill is already planning his political career. In each other, the two find a profound intellectual, emotional, and physical connection that neither has previously experienced.<\/p> <p>In the real world, Hillary followed Bill back to Arkansas, and he proposed several times; although she said no more than once, as we all know, she eventually accepted and became Hillary Clinton.<\/p> <p>But in Curtis Sittenfeld's powerfully imagined tour-de-force of fiction, Hillary takes a different road. Feeling doubt about the prospective marriage, she endures their devastating breakup and leaves Arkansas. Over the next four decades, she blazes her own trail--one that unfolds in public as well as in private, that involves crossing paths again (and again) with Bill Clinton, that raises questions about the tradeoffs all of us must make in building a life.<\/p> <p>Brilliantly weaving a riveting fictional tale into actual historical events, Curtis Sittenfeld delivers an uncannily astute and witty story for our times. In exploring the loneliness, moral ambivalence, and iron determination that characterize the quest for political power, as well as both the exhilaration and painful compromises demanded of female ambition in a world still run mostly by men, Rodham is a singular and unforgettable novel.<br/>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

Kaelen will talk about the basics of using flexdashboard and then give tips on utilizing it to build data product MVPs (minimum viable products) to communicate vision to stakeholders, plus discuss flexdashboard extensions and how to go about converting your flexdash to a Shiny dashboard (if you're ready or even need to!)<\/p> <p>Bio: Kaelen is a data scientist at Medidata Solutions where they work as an R programmer on the microservices team. They've also worked at Spring Health, DataCamp, HERE Technologies, and have done a fair amount of R and Shiny consulting on the side. Kaelen was at various times a film theorist, preschool teacher, test prep tutor, videographer, and nanny before getting a MS in biostatistics from LSU Health Sciences Center in 2016 and starting to work as a statistician and data scientist. They have a cat named Scully and enjoy talking about podcats, aliens, data, and would love to see a photo of your pet if you're sharing.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>R-Ladies is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone.
