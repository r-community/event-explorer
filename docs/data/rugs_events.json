If you would like to attend the event but the registration fee would put a financial strain on you, please reach out to [masked]. There are a limited number of complimentary tickets available.<\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundational knowledge to effectively use some powerful regression models used by data scientists. When data are collected on the same subjects repeatedly over time (for example, in clinical trials or cohort studies) or under different conditions (for example, in a designed experiment), the measurements within the same individual are modeled as having correlated values. At the workshop, we will consider several models that can be employed to model a normally distributed response variable. The models that we will consider are: random slope and intercept (mixed-effects) model and generalized estimating equations models with unstructured, autoregressive, compound symmetric (exchangeable), and independent working correlation matrices. All models will be run in R version 4.0.3.<\/p> <p>The course will be structured as follows. For each part, we will first discuss the theory, then work through an example. After that, the participants will work in small groups in break-out rooms to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material. All the files and Rstudio will be made available to the participants.<\/p> <p>We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be setup and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.<\/p> <p>The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book “Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications” (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/<\/a>), CRC Press, 2018.<\/p> <p># About the Instructor<br/>Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB).

His research is focussed on the intersection between mathematical modelling, data science, and networks in order to provide understanding of various complex systems. This has resulted in research describing the spreading of memes on social media, applying ideas from control theory to financial systems, and even identifying characteristics of successful competitors in Fantasy sports. You can find more information at <a href=\"https://www.joeyobrien.ie/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.joeyobrien.ie/<\/a><\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>Arising from the desire for spectators of sporting contests to obtain more enjoyment, Fantasy sports have become increasing popular in recent years. These sports involve competitors to create virtual teams that score points based upon the statistical performances of the physical athletes. Given the virtual structure of these contests there exists an array of data regarding competitor actions available online as a result of their digital traces. In this talk we will look at some techniques within the R programming language that may be used to parse this data via webscraping procedures. We will then describe one such example study focussing specifically on the Fantasy Premier League, the fantasy equivalent of the top division within English soccer. In particular we will consider visual techniques from the Tidyverse suite of packages that allow a descriptive story regarding the science of success behind those competitors who perform well in the game to be developed.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<br/><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

We will be organizing a workshop which will cover the RNA-seq analysis.<\/p> <p>The ability to easily and efficiently analyse RNA-sequencing data is a key strength of the Bioconductor project. Starting with counts summarised at the gene-level, a typical analysis involves pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the results obtained informing future experiments and validation studies. In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user.

If you would like to attend the event but the registration fee would put a financial strain on you, please reach out to [masked]. There are a limited number of complimentary tickets available.<\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundational knowledge to effectively use some powerful regression models used by data scientists. When data are collected on the same subjects repeatedly over time (for example, in clinical trials or cohort studies) or under different conditions (for example, in a designed experiment), the measurements within the same individual are modeled as having correlated values. At the workshop, we will consider several models that can be employed to model a normally distributed response variable. The models that we will consider are: random slope and intercept (mixed-effects) model and generalized estimating equations models with unstructured, autoregressive, compound symmetric (exchangeable), and independent working correlation matrices. All models will be run in R version 4.0.3.<\/p> <p>The course will be structured as follows. For each part, we will first discuss the theory, then work through an example. After that, the participants will work in small groups in break-out rooms to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material. All the files and Rstudio will be made available to the participants.<\/p> <p>We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be setup and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.<\/p> <p>The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book “Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications” (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/<\/a>), CRC Press, 2018.<\/p> <p># About the Instructor<br/>Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB).

    "description": "<p>Hello everyone, and Happy New Year from the Atlanta R Users Group!<\/p> <p>Following up after last month's informative session on Predictive Learning (thanks again, Steve Pittard), we are looking forward to hosting additional sessions this year to connect the Atlanta R community as well as learn about R.<\/p> <p>As we restart the group we will experiment with a variety of meeting formats. This month we plan to present two topics at about 20 minutes each, followed by an open discussion. Since we will meet via videoconference, we'll limit the meeting to 1 hour to minimize Zoom fatigue.<\/p> <p>Please mark your calendar for January 28th from 7:30P - 8:30P ET for our next meeting, where will share two presentations:<\/p> <p>1. Web Scraping with R, and<br/>2. Reading fixed record and hierarchical data files with R<\/p> <p>Details about how to connect to the Zoom videoconference will be distributed to everyone who RSVPs for the meeting.<\/p> <p>We hope to see you there!<\/p> ",

Ama i dati e la tecnologia, sperimentare e mettersi alla prova. Durante il Master in Data Science ha scoperto la sua vera passione: raccontare i dati. Specializzata in R, data analytics e data visualization, ha ottenuto di recente la certificazione Tableau Desktop Specialist. Il suo mantra è: non temere il fallimento perché è una delle più grosse opportunità per la crescita personale e professionale. Molto sensibile verso il tema della diversità e inclusione nel Tech, è co-fondatrice di #RladiesItaly il cui scopo è sostenere le donne nel settore della data science e data analytics e renderle protagoniste dando voce alle loro aspirazioni e obiettivi.<\/p> <p>Sara Iacozza - Data literacy e storytelling, BI analyst, UX research. “Ho un dottorato di ricerca in neuroscienze cognitive e amo i dati perchè mi danno l’opportunità di capire meglio il comportamento delle persone. Il mio obiettivo è offrire informazioni che siano basate su evidenza e non opinioni. Ho diversi anni di esperienza nel disegnare e portare a termine progetti di ricerca volti a rispondere a esigenze di varia natura. Dal mio punto di vista, le migliori risposte arrivano attraverso un processo che si chiama ​participatory design​, attraverso il quale supporto i diversi stakeholders interessati in un progetto a definire un problema comune. #RLadiesItaly è la realizzazione di un sogno che vede donne e minoranze supportarsi vicendevolmente in un campo che è ancora fortemente maschile é il desiderio di dare senso a quelle ​quote rosa​ tanto, ingiustamente, criticate nel nostro paese.”<\/p> <p>Parvaneh Shafiei - Senior Data scientist con +6 anni di esperienza nell'applicazione della Data science e del Machine Learning in vari settori.

Ha trascorso la maggior parte della sua carriera in società di consulenza per aiutare vari clienti a lanciare e implementare progetti di Machine learning, attualmente è Project Leader in NTT data. È la fondatrice di RladiesMilan, un gruppo dedicato per dare visibilità alle ragazze che lavorano nel settore della tecnologia e della Data science e far crescere più diversità<\/p> <p>Diletta Milana - Data Scientist in ENI<\/p> <p>-----------------<\/p> <p>L'evento è organizzato in partnership con R-Ladies Italy un progetto congiunto tra R-Ladies Bari e R-Ladies Milan, due chapter locali di R-Ladies global. Il loro obiettivo è supportare le donne e le minoranze di genere sottorappresentate nella data science e data analytics. Le donne sono le assolute protagoniste dei loro webinar e vogliono dar loro voce e spazio per raccontare le loro esperienze, ambizioni e obiettivi. Vogliono creare un luogo metafisico di supporto e condivisione. Si concentriano in particolare sul mostrare alle persone che, anche in campi non tradizionalmente legati al mondo della data science, forti competenze sull’analisi dei dati e una mentalità data-driven possono essere una risorsa inestimabile.<\/p> ",

We will then simulate a collaborative team project in which some of us make changes, others work on forked files and others just track how these changes become visible when pulling the latest version. We hope this will foster our understanding of git/github, and be a little fun, too.<\/p> <p>There is no need to prepare anything, but you might want to set up a github account prior to the meeting.

She is passionate about using innovation and technology to tackle issues related to climate change and food security. She obtained her Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from The Ohio State University, and is currently a Senior Air Quality Scientist at Ramboll, San Francisco. She is originally from Chennai, India.<\/p> <p>Abstract: Several communities in the Bay Area are disproportionately impacted by poor air quality. Some cities have established community air monitoring programs to monitor air pollution concentrations in real-time to determine impacts to communities from various pollution sources in the area. Varsha’s talk will focus on a novel methodology developed in her work at Ramboll to determine distinct sources of emissions in the area using a combination of ambient air monitoring data, machine learning, and air dispersion modeling. The talk will focus on the results of the study and how the study provides communities an independent way to monitor emissions from nearby pollution sources.<\/p> <p># NASA Climate Data<br/>Speaker: Alyssa Columbus<br/>NASA Datanaut<\/p> <p>Bio: Alyssa Columbus is a member of the Spring 2018 Class of NASA Datanauts, and her technical guides, tutorials, and articles have been featured by leading organizations, including Forbes, Microsoft, and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).

Have a messy dataset and don't know where to start? Seen beautiful visualizations on Twitter and want to make your own?<\/p> <p>If you’ve answered ‘yes’ to at least one of these questions, fear no more! In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with.

Ggplot2, the tidyverse’s data visualisation package, based on the Grammar of Graphics upon its release in 2005 has been one of the main reasons for its super stardom primarily because of its absolute ease in allowing the user to add, remove or alter components in a plot at a high level of abstraction. The success of the package set the stage for a package to make creating tabular representations as easy. Short for “grammar of tables,\" the goal of gt is similar to that of ggplot2, serving to not just to make it effortless to make specific tables, but to describe a set of underlying components that can be recombined in different ways to solve different problems. All of this with tidyverse’s API makes the syntax simple to grasp for existing users, leading to a beautiful “camera-ready” output within minutes.<\/p> <p>This talk aims to walk the attendees through a typical gt workflow —<br/>Tidy Data —&gt; GT Object —&gt; GT Table, and then syntactically build the various components of a table I.e. the table header, the stub, the column labels and spanner column labels, the table body, and the table footer. In order to make its implementation as holistic as possible , the incorporation of ggplot2 plots inside the gt package will also be demonstrated. Although the workshop will be conducted on an inbuilt R dataset, attendees are free to use any tidy dataset during the workshop. R users of all levels are welcome!<\/p> <p>--&gt; Bio&lt;--<\/p> <p>Majoring in econometrics and completing post graduate programs in statistics, and business management, Manasi has been applying R in an academic setting across a variety of disciplines. Professionally, she has worked in advanced analytics consulting at Nielsen for a couple of years where she comprehensively used R to conduct a range of data play and visualisations in order to deliver impact oriented insights for Top FMCG clients across the South Asia region. She is currently pursuing a fellowship in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and aims to make the next move in the social sector — using data for good! She also leads the R-Ladies Mumbai chapter, and regularly blogs about her explorations with data.

We are super excited to have Jill de Ron, PhD student at the psychological methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA) to bring you a workshop on Network analysis in R!<\/p> <p>DESCRIPTION<br/>-------------------<br/>We can use networks to provide insights into a variety of settings: A network connecting our Facebook friends gains understanding in our social structure; a human contact network gains insight into disease transmission; and a network of public transport lines informs us about the most central subway stations. In these examples, the relationships between components in the network are known. But in a lot of other cases, the relationships between components are unknown and are what we are interested in. For example, when we want to investigate the relationships between different personality traits. Network psychometrics makes it possible to estimate relationships between a large number of variables. Once you estimated a network, you can perform network-based statistics that give you information about the network’s local and global characteristics. In this workshop, you will learn how to estimate, analyze and interpret (psychological) network models. After a short introduction to network models, we will follow by a tutorial on analyzing data with network models.<\/p> <p>PROGRAMME<br/>----------------------<br/>18.30- 18.45 Virtual Welcome<br/>18.45- 20.30 Workshop and Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>ABOUT JILL<br/>-------------------<br/>I am a PhD student at the psychological methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA). My research is concerned with computational models of anxiety disorders and (formal) theory construction in psychology. I have a master’s degree in both Behavioral Data Science and Psychology. During my master programs I have been teaching assistant for the network analysis course at the UvA.<\/p> <p>PREREQUISITES<br/>-----------------------<br/>A basic knowledge of R is recommended. To join the tutorial, please install the bootnet package and the qgraph package.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct. Anyone who violates this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, meetup membership or other condition. We are emphatically queer and trans-friendly. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn.<\/p> ",

So there are a number of free tickets available. Just email [masked] for details.<\/p> <p>The event details provided by OCRUG are as follows:<\/p> <p>Registration is on Eventbrite (<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ocrug-modeling-normally-distributed-data-with-repeated-measures-tickets-135236340535\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ocrug-modeling-normally-distributed-data-with-repeated-measures-tickets-135236340535<\/a>).<\/p> <p>Abstract<br/>This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundational knowledge to effectively use some powerful regression models used by data scientists. When data are collected on the same subjects repeatedly over time (for example, in clinical trials or cohort studies) or under different conditions (for example, in a designed experiment), the measurements within the same individual are modeled as having correlated values. At the workshop, we will consider several models that can be employed to model a normally distributed response variable. The models that we will consider are: random slope and intercept (mixed-effects) model and generalized estimating equations models with unstructured, autoregressive, compound symmetric (exchangeable), and independent working correlation matrices. All models will be run in R version 4.0.3.<\/p> <p>The course will be structured as follows. For each part, we will first discuss the theory, then work through an example. After that, the participants will work in small groups in break-out rooms to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material.

As usual, the meeting will be open for all to attend, and newcomers / beginners are very welcome.<\/p> <p>Our online meetings are kindly being enabled by Red Hat (<a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.redhat.com/<\/a>). In order to join us you need to register with MeetUp (<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/EdinbR/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.meetup.com/EdinbR/<\/a>).<\/p> <p>Our speakers are Alberto Arcagni and Jonathan Sidi.<\/p> <p>* **Alberto Arcagni** (<a href=\"https://web.uniroma1.it/memotef/users/arcagni-alberto\" class=\"linkified\">https://web.uniroma1.it/memotef/users/arcagni-alberto<\/a>) is assistant professor in statistics at the Sapienza University of Rome. His research topics concern income inequality, wellbeing, networks and partially ordered sets. He developed the R packages sBF, ineqJD and parsec.<\/p> <p>* **Jonathan Sidi** (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoniceedee\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/yoniceedee<\/a>) Jonathan Sidi started using R close to 15 years ago, while a research student at the Bank of Israel. Currently, he is the Associate Director of Modeling and Simulation in a pharmaceutical company using R every day to model central nervous system diseases. He maintains and contributes to CRAN packages such as `ggedit`, `ggeasy`, `remedy` and `carbonate` and way too many packages on GitHub.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## parsec: an R package for PARtially ordered sets in Socio-EConomics<\/p> <p>### Alberto Arcagni<br/>In his talk he will describe the main tools provided by the R package \"parsec\" to define partially ordered sets (posets) and their application on the evaluation of multidimensional systems of ordinal indicators with a particular focus on socio-economic analysis.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## Unit Testing Shiny App Reactivity<\/p> <p>### Jonathan Sidi<\/p> <p>When developing Shiny apps there is a lot of reactivity problems that can arise when one reactive or observe element triggers other elements. In some cases these can create cascading reactivity (the horror). The goal of `reactor` is to diagnose these reactivity problems and then plan unit tests to avert them during app development, making it a less painful and more robust experience.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>/federico<\/p> ",

But, if you type in \"white girls,\" the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about \"why black women are so sassy\" or \"why black women are so angry\" presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society.<\/p> <p>In Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.<\/p> <p>Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance-operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond-understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance.<\/p> <p>An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Please join us for a lunchtime R-Ladies meetup with Brittany Barker. Brittany will guide us through a beginner-level tutorial on how and why to use parallel computing in R.<\/p> <p>Brittany is a Research Associate (Postdoc) at the Oregon IPM Center at Oregon State University, where she is developing a spatial modeling platform (written in R) that predicts phenology and climate suitability of invasive insect species in real-time. She is broadly interested in how environmental perturbations such as climate change shape the population dynamics and geographical range limits of plant and animal species.<\/p> <p>In her demo, she will demonstrate the use and value of the parallel, doParallel, and foreach packages for parallel computing in R. The demo will center on analyzing very large spatial data sets, but parallel processing in R can be used for ANY type of data. She will provide examples of when you may want to use parallel computing for your work, and provide further resources to explore.<\/p> <p>This demo will be held over zoom and we will RStudio Cloud so you can follow along with the Brittany's code. We will email out instructions on what to expect and how to get set up.<\/p> <p>~~How to follow Brittany’s tutorial:~~<\/p> <p>**Recommended** Option 1: Create a free RStudio Cloud account and join Brittany’s shared workspace using the link below. This will create a copy of Brittany’s R project for you and allow to run her code. The advantage of using RStudio Cloud is that all of the packages you will need are pre-installed and you’ll be working from the same settings as Brittany. This will make it much easier for us to help you if you run into any problems.<br/><a href=\"https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/119389/join?access_code=412mjNHj6%2BJmLjN24nM8Px6UDtq7qILJh%2B064Io2\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/119389/join?access_code=412mjNHj6%2BJmLjN24nM8Px6UDtq7qILJh%2B064Io2<\/a><\/p> <p>Option 2: If you don’t want to use RStudio Cloud, you can clone Brittany’s repo. You will need to install the R packages ahead of time.

    "description": "<p>For the January 25th edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Dr. Seo-young Silvia Kim as our guest speaker. Dr. Kim will introduce the topic of reproducible workflows for research. Although the term \"research\" brings thoughts of academic research to mind (for example, a dissertation or thesis), these ideas are also directly applicable to other workflows that professional data scientists and analysts encounter in their daily work. Whatever your role, we hope you will come ready to enhance your understanding and appreciation of reproducible workflows and feel empowered to apply this framework in your research.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Reproducible Workflow When Writing a Research Paper<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: College and Ph.D. students who do empirical work often underestimate the problems associated with reproducibility. Certain lessons should be shared for those entering the research phase, which will help not to struggle or waste time later. From setting up an R project to using renv, I discuss some of the most important things that new researchers should be mindful of when starting a new data analysis project.<\/p> <p>Bio: I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Government at American University. I received my Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 2020. My research interests are in American Politics and Political Methodology, focusing on political behavior (registration/turnout/campaign contributions), working with large voter files and Federal Election Commission datasets. I mainly use R and Stan to employ tools such as probabilistic record linkage, semiparametric regressions, machine learning, and Bayesian statistics.<\/p> <p>Twitter: @sysilviakim<\/p> <p>Website: sysilviakim.com<\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.

    "description": "<p>Happy New Year! For the February edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Kaelen Medeiros as our guest speaker. Kaelen will introduce the topic of flexdashboards.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Let’s Build a Flexdashboard!<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: Don’t want to stand up an entire Shiny app to make a quick dashboard, but you know RMarkdown? Enter flexdashboard, which allows you to create a dashboard using a RMarkdown file. In this short workshop, we’ll build a flexdashboard by exploring and visualizing metrics for a pre-specified open dataset. We’ll learn the basics of flexdashboard while brainstorm dashboard design ideas, calculate and display our metrics, and discuss possible deployment options.<\/p> <p>Bio: Kaelen is a data scientist at Medidata Solutions where they work as an R programmer on the microservices team. They've also worked at Spring Health, DataCamp, HERE Technologies, and have done a fair amount of R and Shiny consulting on the side. Kaelen has been at various times in their life a film theorist, preschool teacher, test prep tutor, videographer, and nanny before getting a MS in Biostatistics from LSU Health Sciences Center in 2016 and starting work as a statistician and data scientist. Outside of work they enjoy podcasts, cats, aliens, nail polish, and data.<\/p> <p>Twitter: twitter.com/kaelen_medeiros<\/p> <p>Website: klmedeiros.com<\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.

But what happens<br/>if, with repeated use, they start to grow impatient and would like it to<br/>run faster, or if the userbase increases and the app cannot easily cope<br/>with the growing demand? We are suddenly in the realm of performance<br/>optimisation. But what does this entail? In this introductory talk, I<br/>will mention some principles and tools to help you along this journey:<br/>from how you should think about performance improvements before you even<br/>get started, to how you should test, measure or boost performance with<br/>tools such as {shinyloadtest} or {profvis}, or caching and more.<\/p> <p>----------<\/p> <p>Dean Attali (<a href=\"https://deanattali.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://deanattali.com/<\/a>) is a Shiny Consultant based in Canada.

    "description": "<p>**Talk**<\/p> <p>Shiny is arguably the most popular framework among data scientists for building advanced data apps. Once you build the Shiny application two questions loom: how to keep the input data up-to-date, and where to host it. The answers are often related. For example, if your data is in an on-premise database, you cannot host your app in the cloud. As data grows and changes, keeping the input to the application becomes more challenging. I have seen many enterprise users, implementing a two-step architecture. They run regular batch jobs to fetch and summarize data from their data lake or data warehouse into a staging environment. The Shiny app, then, loads staged data and presents advanced analytics to end-users.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I will show how you can use Apache Spark and the Delta Lake open source projects in your Shiny applications to directly load data from the Lake House. I will discuss how such a unified approach can remove several \"moving parts\" and simplify your work. I will present what the Lake House architecture is, and how R programs can interact with the Lake House using SparkR or sparkly. I will also demo examples of interactively developing and hosting simple Shiny apps that access large data on Databricks.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: Hossein Falaki<\/p> <p>Currently, I am a staff software engineer at Databricks.

This second workshop will introduce participants to mixed models, which are otherwise known as multilevel models or sometimes also hierarchical linear models. These models are crucial for dealing with cases of non-independence, such as when multiple data points are collected from the same individual, or from the same school, district, institution, country, or any other grouping variable. After a brief conceptual introduction, the workshop gives a quick tutorial on how to use the lme4 and afex packages to fit a generalized linear mixed effects model in R.<\/p> <p>Please feel welcomed even if you didn’t make it to the first session as Bodo will begin with a very quick recap of part one anyway.<\/p> <p>In case you want to see what was covered in part one, here is a link to a recording of the first session: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/35CwxVz\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/35CwxVz<\/a><\/p> <p>A repo with access to the hands-on materials will be distributed closer to the date of the workshop.<\/p> ",

So how do you get your R scripts to run? In this talk I hope to inspire lone data scientists on all the ways you can run your Rscript in the cloud. I cover some simple and more advanced use cases for running R in the cloud. I also talk about cooperating with IT for maximum results.<\/p> <p># Speaker<br/>I'm a maker, I love to build useful (machine learning) tools for people and I love sharing what I learned.

    "description": "<p>Data Science for (gender) equality<\/p> <p>In this talk I will discuss the role of artificial intelligence in precision Despite improvements, women in STEM are still facing more challenges than their male colleagues: they earn less, more likely to leave their tech job being, and their work receives less acknowledgment. These disparities persist, despite evidence that integrated female members increase the overall intelligence of teams and gender heterogeneous teams are more creative and productive. Recent years' scandals in the tech industry brought attention to women’s marginalization in STEM. In my talk, I will showcase large-scale data-driven studies from my research to illustrate that increasing the number of women itself will not solve the problem. On examples from open source software engineering, video game development, and organizational collaborations I will describe why we should not focus only on diversity and how data science can help to fight against unconscious bias.<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://x-europe-ds-for-equality.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://x-europe-ds-for-equality.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Orsolya Vasarhelyi, PhD<br/>Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Warwick<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/orsolya-vasarhelyi-43132925/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/orsolya-vasarhelyi-43132925/<\/a><\/p> <p>Orsolya Vasarhelyi, Ph.D. is a data scientist, educator, and public speaker.

The formula syntax is very similar to that of the lme4 package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p># Speaker<\/p> <p>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany).

Her journey in R began two years ago, doing data analysis, modeling and applications with shiny. Cristal's background is in urban logistics researching, supply chain, and business intelligence analysis, and is an active member of volunteer communities in Costa Rica to learn and teach data science in an inclusive, accessible, and inspiring way to be able to be a promoter community in the area hand in hand with volunteering educational.<\/p> <p>Maria Kamenetsky's Abstract: Many learners are often intimidated by entering a statistics or programming course and may even ask for what topics they can review in advance. While recommending textbooks is helpful, learners limited in time may not be able to review that much material. In this talk, I will briefly present the learnr package and how it can be used as a self-assessment tool to help learners efficiently review course material.<\/p> <p>Bio: Maria is a PhD candidate in Epidemiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her research focus is in spatial epidemiology, specifically developing statistical methods for spatial and spatio-temporal cluster detection and estimation.

Having seen this done once, you will be able to go back through any of the popular, free online Git tutorials to pick up the details.<\/p> <p>If you frequently delete a local clone of a GitHub repository and clone the original again, because your local repository is hopelessly \"broken\" when you try to synchronize with your colleagues' changes ... This discussion is for you!<\/p> <p>If you have lost work in the past, so now you do not trust Git to manage your revisions ... This discussion is for you!<\/p> <p>If you have played with Git a little, but you do not know how to make a Pull Request to contribute to a collaborative project ... This discussion is for you! A Q&amp;A session will follow<\/p> <p>When: February 16th, 2021 @ 6:30-8 PM<\/p> <p>Where: Online: zoom info provided when you respond<\/p> <p>Agenda:<\/p> <p>• Jim Tyhurst will do a short demonstration of git commands.<\/p> <p>• Brief intro/R project or problem: We'll take turns talking about an R project we're working on, a data/data-science problem, or something we want to learn, etc.<\/p> <p>• Next, anyone can share some code they've been working on and want help with / want feedback on. Make sure to have this ready before the meeting.<\/p> <p>• Before arriving, use the pdxrlang/aggregate GitHub repository to discuss ideas for things to work on at aggregate - <a href=\"https://github.com/pdxrlang/aggregate/issues\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/pdxrlang/aggregate/issues<\/a><\/p> <p>Please note that this event, like all PDX R events, adheres to the PDX R Code of Conduct: <a href=\"https://pdxrlang.com/code_of_conduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://pdxrlang.com/code_of_conduct<\/a> We are dedicated to a safe learning environment to all.<\/p> <p>If you have any trouble message Marley Buchman in the meetup app, or on Twitter at @pdxrlang<\/p> ",

Suess<br/>Professor, Statistics and Biostatistics, Engineering, CSU East Bay<br/>machineVantage, Chief Statistician<\/p> <p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>In this talk we will introduce the COVID-19 Data Hub and the associated R R package. The COVID-19 Data Hub is an R Consortium supported project created by Emanuele Guidotti and David Ardia. The COVID-19 package provides access to a curated up-to-date dataset containing counts of various measures of the pandemic from nearly all countries around the world at 3 levels of aggregation, when available: Country, State, and City.<\/p> <p>We will give examples of the use of the main function provided by the package and its few options, and some suggested usages of the data. We will examine the inner workings of the project, including the website, where user input can be submitted, the Github site, where code submissions can be made, and finally we will look at the process for adding data.<\/p> <p>A project plan for inviting users to join the effort for further improvement and maintenance of the project will be presented.<\/p> <p>#############<br/>Yu-Shih is a fourth year undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of California, Davis, and his research and interest lies mainly in the field Artificial Intelligence.<\/p> <p>TDAsweep: A Novel Dimension Reduction Method for Image Classification Tasks<\/p> <p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>One of the most celebrated achievements of modern machine learning technology is the automatic classification of images. However, success is typically achieved only with major computational costs.

    "description": "<p>Just getting involved with R or want to level up your skills? Have you used base-R but are still trying to wrap your head around the tidyverse \"pipe\" (%&gt;%)? Have a messy dataset and don't know where to start? Seen beautiful visualizations on Twitter and want to make your own?<\/p> <p>If you’ve answered ‘yes’ to at least one of these questions, fear no more! In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with.

Please see event details below:<br/>----------------------------------------------<\/p> <p>New year, new meetup! We're back in February with part 2 of the Generalized Linear Models workshop by Bodo Winter.<\/p> <p>In part one, Bodo Winter gave an introduction to linear models and generalized linear models. This second workshop will introduce participants to mixed models, which are otherwise known as multilevel models or sometimes also hierarchical linear models. These models are crucial for dealing with cases of non-independence, such as when multiple data points are collected from the same individual, or from the same school, district, institution, country, or any other grouping variable. After a brief conceptual introduction, the workshop gives a quick tutorial on how to use the lme4 and afex packages to fit a generalized linear mixed effects model in R.<\/p> <p>Please feel welcomed even if you didn’t make it to the first session as Bodo will begin with a very quick recap of part one anyway.<\/p> <p>In case you want to see what was covered in part one, here is a link to a recording of the first session: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/35CwxVz\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/35CwxVz<\/a><\/p> <p>A repo with access to the hands-on materials will be distributed closer to the date of the workshop.<\/p> ",

It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.<\/p> <p>Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”<\/p> <p>Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed..<\/p> <p>PS This book is available free online: <a href=\"https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/<\/a><\/p> ",

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes.

The range of functionalities has expanded and some very interesting extensions have been created. There is the officedown package that increases the layout capabilities of R Markdown when the output is Word, the rvg package to create editable vector graphics, the flextable package to make nice tables.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, you will see how to use the package to produce PowerPoint presentations and Word documents. Its role as a foundation for other packages and new documentation will be discussed. It will also be an opportunity for David to present the officedown package for the first time.<\/p> <p>## Speaker<\/p> <p>David Gohel is the founder of ArData, a French company providing R expertise, R training and consulting in data sciences. He is the author of R packages, most popular are officer, flextable, rvg and ggiraph.<\/p> <p>He is a data scientist and software engineer. His professional experiences led him to face many challenges related to the data of organizations, which he has always managed with solutions involving R software.<\/p> ",

Here is one explanation:<\/p> <p>We often have collections of documents, such as blog posts or news articles, that we’d like to divide into natural groups so that we can understand them separately. Topic modeling is a method for unsupervised classification of such documents, similar to clustering on numeric data, which finds natural groups of items even when we’re not sure what we’re looking for.<\/p> <p>Please remember to RSVP or you won't be able to get the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Hope you can make it!<\/p> <p>Ray<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Les réseaux bayésiens pour la modélisation des toxicités aiguës dans le cadre du traitement par radiothérapie du cancer du sein.<\/p> <p>Ces dernières décennies, l'augmentation considérable du volume de données médicales a fait naître, chez les structures hospitalières, le besoin de s'inscrire dans une démarche Big Data, afin de stocker leurs données mais également d'intégrer leur exploitation au sein des différents projets de recherches qu'elles supportent. À ce titre, la Data Science a fait son entrée dans le monde médical par l'intermédiaire d'algorithmes de Machine Learning et de Deep Learning ainsi que des méthodes d'analyse statistique. Un réseau bayésien est un modèle probabiliste utilisé pour représenter les relations de dépendance conditionnelle (et dans certains cas de causalité) entre différentes variables. Souvent oubliée par la communauté scientifique lors de l'analyse de données, cette méthode présente pourtant de nombreux avantages qui peuvent se révéler être des atouts de taille pour l'analyse de données médicales<\/p> ",

An after-thought or as place-holders for numbers.
