Furthermore, Sentinel-2 sensors, including 13 spectral bands in the visible and infrared wavelengths, provide very valuable information which can be used to automatically perform tasks such as classify crop types, assess forest changes, or monitor build-up area development. This is particularly important now, in the era of rapid changes in the environment related to climate change. In R, there are plenty of tools and packages which can be used for satellite images such as pre-processing, analyzing, and visualizing data in a simple and efficient way. Also, the variety of methods, such as machine learning algorithms, are available in R and can be applied in the analysis of satellite imagery. I would like to show the framework for acquiring, pre-processing and preliminary analysis of the Sentinel-2 time series in R. It includes the spectral indices calculation, the use of the machine learning algorithms in the classification of land cover, and, the analysis of time series of imagery, i.e. determining the changes in environment based on the spectral trajectories of pixels.<\/p> <p>Biography:<br/>Ewa is a Ph.D. candidate in geography at the Jagiellonian University, and a research assistant at the Faculty of Forestry, the University of Agriculture in Kraków. In her research, she focus on the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in determining different forest characteristics, such as tree species composition or detection of forest disturbances. She is also a big R enthusiast and she mostly use it in my analysis!<\/p> ",

Dragonfly is passionate about using automation to make their work as reproducible as possible. Caleb will talk about the techniques he uses to automate his work and build pipelines that run from the raw data right through to a final report or a website.<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<br/>Caleb has been working at Dragonfly as a Data Scientist for over 2 years. His work is on applying machine learning to Māori language by training speech processing pipelines using machine learning. Before Dragonfly he worked at Stats NZ, where he was a subject matter expert in statistical confidentiality for integrated data. Nowadays, he is outspoken on the societal implications of the use of data and algorithms in the modern age.<\/p> ",

In fact, the R package “multiROC” implements such extensions. We will briefly discuss these extensions and consider the following question: if multiclass classification metrics can be used for problems with n classes, do they apply to the special case of binary classification, i.e. n=2?<\/p> <p>#<br/>R Horton<br/>Six Ways to Think About ROC Curves<br/>We will walk through six ways to understand ROC curves:<\/p> <p>1. The discrete \"Turtle's Eye\" view, where labeled cases are sorted by score, and the path of the curve is determined by the order of positive and negative cases.<\/p> <p>2. The categorical view, where we have to handle tied scores, or when scores put cases in sortable buckets.<\/p> <p>3. The continuous view, where the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the positive cases is plotted against the CDF for the negative cases.<\/p> <p>4. The ROC curve can be thought of as the limit of the cumulative gain curve (or \"Total Operating Characteristic\" curve) as the prevalence of positive cases goes to zero.<\/p> <p>5. The probabilistic view, where AUC is the probability that a randomly chosen positive case will have a higher score than a randomly chosen negative case.<\/p> <p>6. The ROC curve emerges from a graphical interpretation of the Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon U Test Statistic, which illustrates how AUC relates to this commonly used non-parametric hypothesis test.<\/p> <p>Once we're covered how to think about ROC curves, we'll look at some examples of using them to diagnose issues with machine learning classifiers<\/p> <p>#<br/>J Mount<br/>How to Pick an Optimal Utility Threshold Using the ROC Plot<\/p> <p>One of the classic applications of the ROC plot is to encode the efficient frontier of optimal specificity and sensitivity tradeoffs for a given signal detection problem. We will show the classic derivation of how to translate concrete business goals into the ROC framework and then use the ROC plot to pick off the optimal classification threshold for a given problem. I will emphasize discovering utility requirements through iterated negotiation.<\/p> <p>A sneak peek of some of the points can be found here: <a href=\"https://win-vector.com/2020/10/10/how-to-pick-an-optimal-utility-threshold-using-the-roc-plot/\" class=\"linkified\">https://win-vector.com/2020/10/10/how-to-pick-an-optimal-utility-threshold-using-the-roc-plot/<\/a><\/p> <p>#<br/>N Zumel<br/>Squeezing the Most Utility from Your Models<\/p> <p>The ROC concisely expresses all the sensitivity/specificity tradeoffs achievable by a given probability (or other score-returning) model. Generally, one converts such a model into a \"hard\" classifier by picking a decision threshold. A good threshold balances classifier precision/recall or sensitivity/specificity in a way that best meets the project or business needs. Unfortunately, the ROC is not the best visualization for picking the optimal threshold.<\/p> <p>A more direct way to quantify and think about this optimal threshold is the notion of model utility, which maps the performance of a model to some notion of the value achieved by that performance. In this talke, we discuss how to estimate model utility and pick model thresholds for classification problems.<\/p> <p>For an advance peek at some of these ideas see here: <a href=\"https://win-vector.com/2020/10/05/squeezing-the-most-utility-from-your-models/\" class=\"linkified\">https://win-vector.com/2020/10/05/squeezing-the-most-utility-from-your-models/<\/a><\/p> ",

La raccolta di informazioni è necessaria per aiutare un sito web a crescere, targetizzare i clienti o analizzare fenomeni sociali. Riconoscendo questo problema, tante entità come Google e Apple, stanno promuovendo migliori tecniche di tutela e protezione della privacy. È qui che entra in gioco l'anonimizzazione dei dati.<\/p> <p>📣 Cos'è l'anonimizzazione dei dati e perché è importante?<\/p> <p>L'anonimizzazione dei dati rende non identificabili le informazioni identificabili. Ciò avviene tramite tecniche di elaborazione dati che rimuovono o codificano i dati personali. Quindi i dati diventano anonimi e non possono essere collegati a nessun individuo. L'anonimizzazione dei dati consente di rispettare i GDPR di tutto il mondo.<\/p> <p>In questo meetup esploreremo i metodi e le tecniche di base per la codifica dei dati che statistici e data scientist utilizzano per rendere anonimi i dati con R.<\/p> <p>Utilizzeremo il dataset prodotto dalle vostre risposte al seguente sondaggio ⬅️ compila il sondaggio e non mancare! 🙋‍♀️<\/p> <p>COMPILA IL SONDAGGIO: <a href=\"https://forms.gle/TTwTECZqfW9Af5nz8\" class=\"linkified\">https://forms.gle/TTwTECZqfW9Af5nz8<\/a><\/p> ",

It is being used to run R code in parallel on the local computer, on remote machines, in the cloud, and on high-performance computing. Popular packages such as 'shiny’, ‘plumber’, and ‘drake’ use futures internally.

A single round of computation can take several hours to complete, and routine updates to the code and data tend to invalidate hard-earned results. You can enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of such projects with the targets R package. targets resolves the dependency structure of your analysis pipeline, skips tasks that are already up to date, executes the rest with optional distributed computing, and manages data storage for you. It surpasses the permanent limitations of its predecessor, drake, and provides increased efficiency and a smoother user experience. This talk demonstrates how to create and maintain a Bayesian model validation project using targets-powered automation.<\/p> <p>About Will:<br/>Will is a statistician and software developer.

The workshop will cover handy one time functions (i.e., use_this::create_package) as well as functions used continuously throughout package development (i.e., devtools::document). At the end of the hour you should have a working, well-documented package with a single function, as well as a better understanding of the files and file structure required for R packages.<\/p> <p>This workshop is suitable for beginner to intermediate R users. Attendees should be familiar with functions, but will not be writing their own function in this workshop. Familiarity with pipe or tidyverse is helpful.<\/p> <p>Speaker<\/p> <p>Shannon Pileggi is an enthusiastic statistical collaborator and professional educator with over ten years of experience partnering on data analysis with diverse stakeholders in corporate settings, tech, public health, and clinical research. Shannon’s previous work experiences include supporting research on parasitic diseases at the CDC, developing a pilot college-wide intro stats course at the Institute for Quantitative Theory and Methods at Emory University, and instructing R/SAS programming, intro stats, and survival analysis courses at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. Shannon is currently a Statistician at Adelphi Research in Doylestown, PA working in pharmaceutical market research.

Implemented in an easily installed package with a detailed vignette, treeheatr can be a useful teaching tool to enhance students’ understanding of a simple decision tree model before diving into more complex tree-based machine learning methods.<\/p> <p>Trang is a postdoctoral fellow with Jason Moore at the Computational Genetics Lab, University of Pennsylvania. She enjoys developing machine learning methods for analyses of biomedical data, including neuroimage (functional/structural MRI), transcriptomics and genotypes. Most of the datasets she works with are high dimensional (i.e., have many predictors/features), so she spends most of her time building feature selection algorithms for these data. She trades her bias toward the nearest-neighbor concept for lower variance of her methods and better generalizability. When she is not knee deep in data, she runs, dance and seasonally skis.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~MATERIALS~~~~~~~~~<br/>slides: <a href=\"https://slides.com/trang1618/treeheatr-pmlbr\" class=\"linkified\">https://slides.com/trang1618/treeheatr-pmlbr<\/a><br/>material doc: <a href=\"https://slides.com/trang1618/treeheatr-pmlbr\" class=\"linkified\">https://slides.com/trang1618/treeheatr-pmlbr<\/a><\/p> ",

She has collaborated with medical and surgical oncologists in the design and analysis of large-scale Phase III cancer clinical trials, using survival and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. She has also worked closely with radiation biologists in developing and implementing innovative dose response designs for Phase I and II studies to evaluate dose escalation of radiation therapy, with immunologists developing designs for Phase II studies to evaluate combination therapy with biologic agents, and has used robust regression and data visualization tools in S-Plus and R to visualize dose response surfaces for combination antifungal drug therapy in murine models and in vitro drug susceptibility testing. Now retired, Dr. Madeline Bauer helps high school students with their science projects, mentors undergraduate statistics and data science students preparing for ASA DataFest, and serves as a co-organizer for R-Ladies Irvine.<\/p> <p>Abstract: The general purpose of developing a regression model is to understand the association between a response Y and X and/or to predict Y given X, where X is a set of independent variables. In this talk, we give an overview of regression and highlight some of the regression packages available in R. We start with examples of suggested best workflow practices that are useful regardless of the specific regression model. For model-specific workflows, we take advantage of the \"methods\" associated with the model, such as \"summary\", \"print\", and especially \"plot.\" These methods illustrate the individual package author’s approaches to check the model assumptions, estimate the association between the response and the covariates and evaluate the fit and accuracy of the resulting model. We will demonstrate these methods with real datasets. The data and R code will be available to download.<\/p> <p># A Study of Medical Treatments for COVID-19<br/>Speaker: Song Zhai<\/p> <p>Bio: Song Zhai is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at UC, Riverside. After finishing his master degree in the Department of Mathematics at Texas A&amp;M University, Song Zhai joined UCR in Fall 2016, under the supervision of Dr. Xinping Cui. Song’s previous projects include a retrospective study for biomarker selection with Parkside Medical Group; efficient polygenic risk score developing at Merck; and best predictive biomarker identification with Xinping. Song’s research focus is on pharmacogenomics, with an emphasis on applications rooted in biomarker study, multiple testing, and causal inference.<\/p> <p>Abstract: To the end of this study, various medical treatments for COVID-19 are attempted. A total of 417 patients were considered and 414 of them were included in this study (3 deaths) with mild-to-critical COVID-19. Patients were followed up for recurrence for 28 days quarantine after being discharged. We applied the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to overcome the rare recurring events in certain patient subgroups. Virtual Twins Matching (VTM) analysis, facilitated by random forest regression, was performed for medical treatment-recurrence classification, while minimizing effects of confounding factors. We used the Multiple Comparisons with the Best (MCB) as the test of the best drug combination in each patient subgroup. The insights into combinatorial therapy found in this study shed light on the use of a combination of (biological and chemical) anti-virus therapy and/or anti-cytokine storm as a potentially effective therapeutic treatment for COVID-19.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

Furthermore, Sentinel-2 sensors, including 13 spectral bands in the visible and infrared wavelengths, provide very valuable information which can be used to automatically perform tasks such as classify crop types, assess forest changes, or monitor build-up area development. This is particularly important now, in the era of rapid changes in the environment related to climate change. In R, there are plenty of tools and packages which can be used for satellite images such as pre-processing, analyzing, and visualizing data in a simple and efficient way. Also, the variety of methods, such as machine learning algorithms, are available in R and can be applied in the analysis of satellite imagery. I would like to show the framework for acquiring, pre-processing and preliminary analysis of the Sentinel-2 time series in R. It includes the spectral indices calculation, the use of the machine learning algorithms in the classification of land cover, and, the analysis of time series of imagery, i.e. determining the changes in environment based on the spectral trajectories of pixels.<\/p> <p>Biography:<br/>Ewa is a Ph.D. candidate in geography at the Jagiellonian University, and a research assistant at the Faculty of Forestry, the University of Agriculture in Kraków. In her research, she focus on the use of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in determining different forest characteristics, such as tree species composition or detection of forest disturbances. She is also a big R enthusiast and she mostly use it in my analysis!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>About the instructor: Join Dr. Maria C. Ramos, a Visiting Research Fellow at Duke Network Analysis Center (www.mariacramos.com), for her workshop on network analysis. Maria Ramos is a social scientist and networks scholar. She recently obtained a PhD in Sociology from Duke University and is now a Visiting Research Fellow at Duke Network Analysis Center. Maria’s research portfolio is diverse and interdisciplinary. Her current projects employ network science to understand HIV prevention, social-ecological systems, collaboration within organizations, and networks of beliefs and mental models. Maria regularly consults with organizations and research teams interested in leveraging network analysis to solve applied problems. She is also an avid R user and loves developing and teaching R workshops and tutorials.<\/p> <p>Workshop description: We live in an interconnected world: from the Web, transportation systems, and disease spread to our friendships and families, many aspects of our lives consist of interdependencies and connections among entities. Network analysis provides a framework and a set of tools for studying systems and patterns of relationships. This workshop will provide a gentle introduction to network analysis' concepts, methods, and applications. We will begin with an overview of the networks approach and its applications in various disciplines. Through hands-on activities, we will visualize networks and assess their general structure using different indices. We will also identify subgroups and key players. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to examine networks and characterize their properties using R.<\/p> <p>PLEASE NOTE: We will be automatically recording this event. If you do *not* wish to be recorded, please be sure to keep your video/camera turned OFF.<\/p> ",

He is the creator and contributor to a number of R packages (**reporteR**, **MESS**, **MethComp**, **SuperRanker**) and is the author of \"The R Primer\" book. He has previously given R tutorials at useR 2016, eRum 2018, and ASAs Conference on Statistical Practice 2018, and won the C. Oswald George prize from Teaching Statistics in 2014.<\/p> <p>### Anne Helby Petersen<br/>is a PhD student in biostatistics at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. She is the primary author of several R packages, including **reporteR**. She has taught statistics and R in numerous courses at the University of Copenhagen with students coming from a wide range of backgrounds, including science, medicine and mathematics.<\/p> <p># Talk description<\/p> <p>## Clean up your data screening process with **reporteR**<br/>Data cleaning and data validation are the first steps in practically any data analysis, as the validity of the conclusions from the analysis hinges on the quality of the input data.<\/p> <p>Mistakes in the data can arise for any number of reasons, including erroneous codings, malfunctioning measurement equipment, and inconsistent data generation manuals. Consequently, it is essential to enable topic experts who are knowledgeable about the context and data collection procedure to partake in the data quality assessment since they will be better at identifying potential problems in the data. However, they may not have the technical skills to work with the data themselves.<\/p> <p>The reporteR package (formerly known as dataMaid) makes it easy to produce a document that less R-savvy collaborators can read, understand and use to decide “do these data look right?” and documents which potential errors were considered. Both will help ensure subsequent reproducible data science and document the data at all stages of the quality assessment process.<\/p> <p>The package includes both very user-friendly one-liner commands that auto-generates data overview reports, as well as a highly customizable suite of data validation and documentation tools that can be moulded to fit most data validation needs. And, perhaps most importantly, it was specifically build to make sure that documentation and validation go hand in hand, so we can clean up any unstructured messy data cleaning process.<\/p> <p># Sponsor<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an advanced analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.

    "description": "<p>We have 3 confirmed lightning presentations for December's meetup!<br/>Additional details to be provided.<\/p> <p>Talk 1:<br/>Title: Advancing pre-clinical research with R and cloud computing<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>R has been the popular tool of choice for performing bioinformatics analysis by researchers in the drug discovery space given the availability of many open-source packages and libraries in the public domain. These open-source tools enable researchers to analyze and generate insights from their biomedical data. Typically, the analysis and the consumption of insights is done via an interactive web interface powered by shiny, an R package to build web-apps. However, our experience developing traditional shiny apps for biological (omics) data analysis, has exposed to us problems related to the handling of voluminous datasets, and the associated computationally expensive jobs, typical characteristics of biological data. Then, there is also the problem of workflow customisability, as a shiny app is often built to cater to one specific use case. But it is often desired to have a certain degree of flexibility and customisability in-built into the system, which would allow the end-users themselves to create their own workflow by stitching together the atomic components. Here, we describe how we have leveraged cloud computing services to mitigate these issues and create an infrastructure which would enable the bioinformaticians to perform data analysis in an easy and intuitive manner, and at the same time giving them the liberty to package their R code as a custom component, without having to worry about how to make their code production-ready. Our infrastructure platform manages the allocation of machine resources required to execute the component.<\/p> ",

Recently, serverless computing has been touted as the panacea for elastic compute that can provide flexibility and lower operating costs. However, for ML, the need to precisely define hardware configurations and long warm-up times of certain ML models exacerbate the limitations of serverless. To provide the best solution to our customers, we have run extensive benchmarking experiments comparing the performance of serverless and traditional computing for inference workloads running on Kubernetes (with KubeFlow and with the ModelDB MLOps Toolkit). Our experiments have spanned a variety of model types, data modalities, hardware, and workloads.

As a relatively new career, it is ambiguously defined, and the job description of a data scientist can vary greatly from company to company. For those reasons, Data Science has attracted both new grads and career changers from all sorts of different fields. For Statisticians, Data Science is an exciting opportunity to apply your hard-earned skills to a variety of interesting and challenging problems. Having a solid Statistics background will give you a head start in that direction. However, Data Science is much more than pure Statistics knowledge. Being able to recognize and take advantage of a team with a diverse set of experiences will provide you with a unique opportunity to grow individually while benefiting your entire team. In this talk, I will walk you through my career journey, the different roles a Data Scientist can take, useful skills for a successful career, and lessons learned.<\/p> <p>~ Bio ~<br/>Gabriela de Queiroz is a Sr. Engineering &amp; Data Science Manager at IBM where she manages and leads a team of developers working on Data &amp; AI Open Source projects.<br/>She works to democratize AI by building tools and launching new open source projects. She is passionate about making data science available to everybody and is actively involved with several organizations to foster an inclusive community.<br/>She is the founder of AI Inclusive (ai-inclusive.org), a global organization that is helping increase the representation and participation of gender minorities in Artificial Intelligence. She is also the founder of R-Ladies (rladies.org), a worldwide organization for promoting diversity in the R community with more than 180 chapters in 50+ countries.<br/>She has worked in several startups and where she built teams, developed statistical models, and employed a variety of techniques to derive insights and drive data-centric decisions.<br/>She likes to mentor and shares her knowledge through mentorship programs, tutorials, and talks.<\/p> ",

But, if you type in \"white girls,\" the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about \"why black women are so sassy\" or \"why black women are so angry\" presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society.<\/p> <p>In Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.<\/p> <p>Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance-operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond-understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance.<\/p> <p>An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>For the December edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Stephanie Kirmer as our guest speaker. She will introduce the topic of Isolation Forests for tree-based anomaly detection.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Branching Out into Isolation Forests: Tree Based Anomaly Detection<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract:<br/>Isolation forests offer a new way to approach unsupervised anomaly detection problems, and in this talk attendees will get an end-to-end tutorial with code and visual explanations on how to apply the technique in R. Among other advantages, isolation forests offer interpretability and rapid runtime, so they are useful in business and production settings.<\/p> <p>Bio:<br/>Stephanie Kirmer is a Senior Data Scientist at Saturn Cloud, a platform enabling easy to use parallelization and scaling for Python with Dask. (But she still loves R as well.) Previously she worked as a DS Tech Lead at Journera, a travel data startup, and Senior Data Scientist at Uptake, where she developed predictive models for diagnosing and preventing mechanical failure. Before joining Uptake, she worked on data science for social policy research at the University of Chicago and taught sociology and health policy at DePaul University.<\/p> <p>Slides/Code:<br/>Stephanie's slides were prepared using the R xaringan package and are available in the following github repository in the 'r' subdirectory. Code used in her demo are also provided in the repo. You are invited to follow along during the presentation. <a href=\"https://github.com/skirmer/isolation_forests\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/skirmer/isolation_forests<\/a><\/p> <p>Twitter: @data_stephanie<\/p> <p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.stephaniekirmer.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.stephaniekirmer.com/<\/a><\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.
