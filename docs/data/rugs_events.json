    "description": "<p>Selecting test exercises with an appropriate difficulty level is one of the most important aspects of a high-quality assessment, but how do we know how difficult a given exercise is? <\/p> <p>One of the possible approaches is to use Item Response Theory - a set of psychometric models which can be used to estimate learners’ proficiency and parameters of each exercise. This approach works well in most cases, however, is data intensive. So, the question arises what to do when we don't have enough data, when for example, we are introducing some new exercises.<\/p> <p>Fortunately, probabilistic programming comes to our aid. Using Greta, we can build a custom IRT model, that allows us to quantify how different features of exercises impact their difficulty. In this talk, we will introduce the audience to the basics of IRT and probabilistic programming through a real-world application - estimating the difficulty of English tasks. For this purpose, we will use the previously mentioned Greta package, which lets us write statistical models in native R and sample from them automatically and efficiently.<\/p> <p>### REGISTRATION INFO<\/p> <p>--&gt;&gt;&gt; Registration link: <a href=\"https://xeurope-exercises.carrd.co/\" class=\"linkified\">https://xeurope-exercises.carrd.co/<\/a> &lt;&lt;&lt;--<br/>Please also RSVP here on the Meetup Page.<\/p> <p>### Our Speaker<\/p> <p>Damian Wiatrzyk<br/>LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-wiatrzyk-91803072/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/damian-wiatrzyk-91803072/<\/a><\/p> <p>Damian Wiatrzyk graduated from the Poznań University of Technology with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

S4 classes in R give structure to your data and help you organize your methods. They also help signal to your team members proper use of the data structures you define and what methods are available, in essence, how to use your code properly, and also, how to add to it or modify it later on.<\/p> <p>In this talk, we will empower ourselves by reminding ourselves that data scientists are a particular class of programmers (distinct from those who create PC/console games, those who create mobile apps, those who create websites, etc) but programmers all the same. Then we will briefly discuss the benefits of code encapsulation, especially with respect to packages and S4 classes while touching briefly on other OOP systems in R. We will discuss when and how to implement them, and how to structure your code base in a clean, effective, and consistent manner so that it's clear and easy to understand for your teammates and to yourself.<\/p> <p>Speaker:<br/>Ezra Tucker is the Director of Data Science at Energetic Insurance<\/p> <p>Energetic Insurance is a Managing General Underwriter (MGU) with a novel, data-driven approach to develop new risk management products to unlock exponential growth in the renewable energy industry<\/p> ",

Thanks to cloud hosting and standardized formats, Earth observation data is getting easier to access, but it’s still hard to analyze lots of it. Dask is a logical solution to this problem. Unlike proprietary platforms, like Google Earth Engine, Dask integrates with the Python data science ecosystem—and new tools like stackstac are opening the door to connecting these enormous datasets of global change with the Python ecosystem. Moreover, with a platform like Coiled, it’s easy to scale out your code to the cloud and run it next to the data, letting you process this planet-sized data.<\/p> <p>After attending, you’ll know:<\/p> <p>– The landscape of geospatial tools in Python, and how they do and don’t fit together<br/>– The limits on Earth-scale data in Dask, and what we’re doing to expand them<br/>– [Sneak peek!] Making an interactive map that renders on-the-fly with Dask, stackstac, and Coiled (aka your own mini Earth Engine)<br/>– The one simple trick to remove all clouds from your satellite imagery that doctors DON’T want you to know!! (lol nope, sorry this doesn’t exist.)<\/p> <p>You’ll also learn:<\/p> <p>– What a STAC and COG is, why stacking your COGs is hard, and how Dask+stackstac make this easy<br/>– How to search Earth observation data in STAC catalogs<br/>– How to stack lots of GeoTIFFs into a timeseries using stackstac<br/>– Compositing, clipping, and basic analysis of raster timeseries in xarray<\/p> <p>Join us on 29th April at 11 am US Eastern time to learn about what could come next for Earth observation in Python!<\/p> <p>REGISTER HERE: <a href=\"https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_El_t3XNxSQ2HCr6zU3QzRQ\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_El_t3XNxSQ2HCr6zU3QzRQ<\/a><\/p> ",

NLP models are great at processing digital text, but many real-word applications use documents with more complex formats. For example, healthcare systems often include visual lab results, sequencing reports, clinical trial forms, and other scanned documents. When we only use an NLP approach for document understanding, we lose layout and style information - which can be vital for document image understanding. New advances in multi-modal learning allow models to learn from both the text in documents (via NLP) and visual layout (via computer vision).<\/p> <p>We provide multi-modal visual document understanding, built on Spark OCR based on the LayoutLM architecture. It achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy in several downstream tasks, including form understanding (from 70.7 to 79.3), receipt understanding (from 94.0 to 95.2) and document image classification (from 93.1 to 94.4).<\/p> <p>Register Here: <a href=\"https://events.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-document-understanding-with-multi-modal-image-text-mining-in-spark-ocr-3\" class=\"linkified\">https://events.johnsnowlabs.com/visual-document-understanding-with-multi-modal-image-text-mining-in-spark-ocr-3<\/a><\/p> ",

Through interpolation, the resulting splines can be used to construct high resolution data sets that are more amenable to automated analysis for pattern detection. The application of smoothing splines will be covered in three parts: 1) the key parameters and coding of smoothing splines in R will be discussed using a Shiny app designed to determine inflection points in chemical titrations, 2) a method for detecting complex patterns in time-series data will be discussed using a model designed to identify the ‘Cup and Handle’ pattern in stock prices, and 3) a theoretical discussion of potential applications to generate input and output data for supervised and unsupervised learning.<\/p> <p>Presenter: Dr. Fred Franken<\/p> <p>Fred Franken, Ph.D., has over 15 years of experience in data analysis.

    "description": "<p>When we make an inventory of opportunities to add value to organizations with data, often there is low hanging fruit that does not require much investment in actual data analysis, but can be solved by automating data aspects of business processes. In fact there is a whole industry around this called robotic process automation (RPA). But where RPA offers a low-code approach to setting up automation tasks, it is easy to undervalue R for setting up these tasks with R code.<\/p> <p>In this talk I would like to share some of the experiences we have had automating tasks with R. The tools we use range from great packages like fs to work with the filesystem on the R side. But there are also packages to make it easier to work with cron jobs on Linux (cronR) and the task scheduler on Windows (taskscheduleR).<\/p> <p>When you combine this with other tools of the automation trade like httr to access API's or plumber to write API's there is practically no limit to what you can achieve using only R and readily available tools on linux and windows. I hope that the talk will inspire a lively discussion where we share experiences and ideas about automating processes with R.<\/p> <p>Frans van Dunné (<a href=\"https://www.fransvandunne.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.fransvandunne.com/<\/a>) is Chief Data Officer at ixpantia (<a href=\"https://www.ixpantia.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.ixpantia.com/<\/a>).

Frans has a PhD in biology from the University of Amsterdam and has taught at universities in Europe and Latin America. As a consultant he has worked with companies around the world on diverse topics, including data driven innovation, applied statistics, statistical programming and machine learning.<\/p> <p>Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>The job of a data engineer is to build, manage, and optimize systems for transforming data into forms that facilitate analysis. Despite the broad adoption of R as a language for data science, it has taken a back seat to Python and other languages in the area of data engineering. But this is beginning to change. Data engineering tasks that were previously infeasible in R are becoming straightforward thanks to recent developments in the Apache Arrow project and the R package `arrow`. Arrow provides tools for working with tabular data that emphasize performance, efficiency, standardization, and interoperability with other languages and systems in the broader data ecosystem. Using the R package `arrow`, it is now possible to implement many data engineering and ETL tasks entirely in R, avoiding the overhead of switching to another language Python or using a framework like Spark.<\/p> <p>All skill levels are welcomed.<\/p> <p>Agenda:<br/>6:30pm - 6:40pm Introductions<br/>6:40pm - 7:20pm Topic Presentation<br/>7:20pm - 7:30pm Closing Remarks<\/p> <p>(Topic presentations sometimes run longer than 40 minutes)<\/p> <p>This meetup will be 100% virtual!

    "description": "<p>Productivity in R often boils down to automating repetitive steps, and iterating over a structured dataset is a common task in more complex data manipulation.<\/p> <p>There are many ways to achieve this: While some feel most comfortable writing procedural for-loops, others Vectorize() their functions in order to pass them multiple values at once. Yet another camp swears by the functional style of purrr's map() and reduce() functions (the tidy alternative to the the *apply family of functions in base R). And a fourth category of useRs struggle to get their head wrapped around serializiation in the first place. (Let's just ignore the hopeless cases who write straight-up recursive functions with no concern for stack size.)<\/p> <p>It has been rumored that a more functional style makes everything faster – but is that really true? Doesn't it make the code just too hard to read? And can any loop really be replaced by a map?<\/p> <p>For our May meeting, let's challenge the functional fanboys and *girls among us. Bring a contained, reproducible example loop (side effects welcome!) and we will ask the mapheads to reformulate it as a higher order function.<\/p> <p>As always, useRs of all backgrounds and at all levels of expertise are invited to participate.

Not only do they provide an excellent framework for organizing your code, but they also make it easier to share code with other R users. In this workshop, we’ll develop a simple R package together to gain an understanding of the key steps of package development. I’ll also reflect on my experiences creating an internal package for my team at the BC Ministry of Health. I hope to shed light on the lesser-known non-technical aspects of package development by discussing how to identify what tools your teammates need to succeed and how to encourage them to adopt your package. This workshop is geared towards (but not limited to) those who are new to developing packages and those who are thinking of creating one to share within their organization and beyond.<\/p> <p>**This workshop assumes you know how to write a function in R and are familiar with the RStudio IDE. (See below for resources and required packages) ***<\/p> <p>About the Speaker: Reiko is a data analyst with the Government of British Columbia. In her role, she creates various tools using R to support her team’s work in monitoring trends in population health and health inequalities in the province.

Learn how to best structure your model workflows including reading in data, checking the data, performing analyses, and plotting. The presentation will also go into more advanced topics discussing the R-INLA package for modelling spatio-temporal data. R-INLA is a powerful method that uses integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to create complex models with various types of random effects such as spatial and temporal autocorrelation and run them very fast (<a href=\"https://www.r-inla.org/home\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.r-inla.org/home<\/a>). In this talk, we will specially focus on how to model spatial autocorrelation using coral recovery data. Best for those who are comfortable with R but all are welcome.<\/p> <p>*Who is going to present:<br/>Dr. Julie Vercelloni is a quantitative ecologist that studied Marine Ecology during her undergraduate and postgraduate degrees and statistics applied to coral reef ecology for her PhD. She is now an Associate Investigator at the Queensland University of Technology node of the Australian Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers and works mostly with the Australian Institute of Marine Science.<br/>Julie is doing research on diverse projects that look at combining state-of-the-art technologies including machine learning and virtual reality, and modern statistical modelling methods to help understanding complex problems related to coral reef conservation. She is also a citizen science advocate, working on new types of monitoring for the Great Barrier Reef and Pacific countries.<\/p> <p>* When are we meeting?<br/>The talk will start at 5:30 pm for a ~45 minute presentation, 15 minutes Q&amp;A time with the potential to move to an outside venue for continued socializing and networking.<\/p> <p>* Where are we meeting?<br/>We will meet at QUT Gardens Point campus room Y-801 (in building Y) - this will be a hybrid event with a Zoom link available.<br/>map: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/4H51oEEun6JuewVn6\" class=\"linkified\">https://goo.gl/maps/4H51oEEun6JuewVn6<\/a><br/>DIRECTIONS TO THE ROOM - Y block/building is next to River Stage in QUT Gardens Point.

Social vulnerability is defined as the resilience of communities when dealing with external stresses on health, such as age, housing, race/ethnicity, and more. For analysis, we used multiple linear regression to determine which social vulnerability variables are most directly related with hospital capacity in each county in California, using average bed utilization rate as our measure of hospital capacity. The significant predictors from our model were: the proportion of the county’s population under 17, the percentage of individuals reporting severe housing situations, the proportion of the county's population that are Black, the percentage of single parent households, and the percentage of households with more people than rooms. We then developed a county-level social vulnerability index (SVI) and concluded that there was a relationship between the SVI and COVID-19 case prevalence per county after mapping both of them using Tableau. Our findings suggest that more socially vulnerable counties are less equipped to handle impacts of COVID-19 and more resources should be allocated to them to establish equitable health outcomes. This project was originally created in May 2020, with updates to COVID case rates in December 2020.<\/p> <p># Predicting Benzodiazepines Use<br/>Speakers: Tiffany Feng, Eustina Kim, Diana Pham, Kienna Qin<br/>Seniors, Department of Statistics, UCLA<\/p> <p>Bio: Tiffany Feng, UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Digital Humanities minor; Eustina Kim: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Digital Humanities minor; Diana Pham: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major and Global Health minor; Kienna Qin: UCLA Class of 2021, Statistics Major<\/p> <p>Abstract: This project explores which characteristics among students, health care professionals, and veterans determined the use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) in a sample of participants in the United States during 2018. BZDs are a type of drug that produces sedation and lowers anxiety levels. They are the most commonly prescribed medication in the U.S., and, unfortunately, are frequently abused and taken with other drugs. We used multinomial logistic regression and various data visualizations to determine that having a history of drug use, mental illness, and prescriptions for opioids for treating pain are important in predicting the use of BZD for all three occupations in our sample. The largest impacts for each occupation were a history of drug use for students, mental illness and opioid prescriptions for pain for veterans, and there were similar influences for each category for health professionals. Although our data was not a representative sample, this could still demonstrate the importance of investigating the unique differences in determining BZD use for each occupation, which could lead into interventions such as targeted programs to reduce BZD misuse in each occupation. Hopefully with these insights, we can make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by the misuse of BZDs in the United States.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

Is there data to support these measurements and decisions? We count with a grate panel of women and we invite you too to share your own perspectives!<\/p> <p>Panellists:<\/p> <p>Daloha Rodriguez-Molina<br/>comes from Venezuela.

Have a messy dataset and don't know where to start? Seen beautiful visualizations on Twitter and want to make your own?<\/p> <p>If you’ve answered ‘yes’ to at least one of these questions, fear no more! In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with. You will be able to create new columns and summary tables, subset interesting rows or columns, and combine and reshape dataframes. We will also dive into ggplot, one of the best tools for creating great-looking bar charts, scatterplots, and more!<\/p> <p>This is (currently) a five-part series, aimed at total beginners and/or people with some experience in base-R or tidyverse who are looking to freshen up or expand their skills.

Mi pasión por entender aquello que hace únicas a las personas, y cómo poder hacer esto un valor añadido para la empresa me llevó hasta Australia, Melbourne, donde tras 12 meses obtuve el Diploma de Liderazgo y Dirección. Conocimientos que durante un año y medio pude poner en práctica en el departamento de Recursos Humanos de la empresa LeasePlan. Es aquí donde descubro que estas personas, tú y yo, somos una fuente imparable de datos que bien gestionados pueden no quitarnos poder, sino dárnoslo. Por este motivo en octubre de 2019 decidí embarcarme en esta aventura del análisis de datos, el machine learning. Acabo de llegar, pero cada día tengo más claro que he llegado para quedarme, para aprender, para compartir lo que sé y para participar en esta, la revolución del siglo XXI.<\/p> <p>¡Os esperamos el 11 de mayo!<\/p> ",

The Wallace Lab works to understand how translation works within cells (particularly of fungi) and what factors control and regulate protein synthesis. Flic is part of the development team for the 'riboviz' open source software package for processing and analysis of ribosome profiling data, working with colleagues from EPCC (University of Edinburgh) to make the codebase more robust &amp; sustainable. With a background in Ecology and Botany (previously a Research Assistant at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh), Flic has worked with a wide range of types of biological data using different software tools and programming languages (particularly R) for the last 8 years, and found herself drawn towards bioinformatics and research software engineering. Flic is a member of the Edinburgh Carpentries and a certified Carpentries instructor in foundational coding and data science skills for researchers.<\/p> <p>* **Isabella Deutsch** (<a href=\"https://isabelladeutsch.com\" class=\"linkified\">https://isabelladeutsch.com<\/a>) is a PhD Student at the University of Edinburgh at the School of Mathematics focusing on Bayesian statistics.

This talk will briefly cover the implementation of an Rmarkdown HTML output report and Shiny app for data visualisation of ribosome profiling datasets, added as part of development efforts to make riboviz more user-friendly and effective. Flic will describe the initial approach and pitfalls encountered while developing the new visualisation features, and discuss integrating the visualisation side of riboviz with the recently implemented workflow management system (Nextflow) riboviz has moved to. Including a short primer on what Workflow Management Systems such as Nextflow 'do' and why they're useful for complex data pipelines, and details on how to get Rmarkdown HTML reports to play nicely as part of a Nextflow workflow.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## The ABC of ABC: a handy guide to Approximate Bayesian Computation<\/p> <p>### Isabella Deutsch<\/p> <p>The Guardian called Bayes’ Theorem “obscure”, but I find it rather neat! In this talk I will gently introduce you to Bayesian statistics, with its advantages and criticisms, and guide you towards the first steps in Bayesian data analysis using Approximate Bayesian Computation: what it is, how you program it from scratch in R, and how you can utilise it for your own work.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>/federico<\/p> ",

They maintain the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. They nourish other living organisms and supply psychological benefits to humans as well, improving our moods and beautifying the landscape around us. But plants don’t just passively provide. They also take action.<\/p> <p>Beronda L. Montgomery explores the vigorous, creative lives of organisms often treated as static and predictable. In fact, plants are masters of adaptation. They “know” what and who they are, and they use this knowledge to make a way in the world. Plants experience a kind of sensation that does not require eyes or ears. They distinguish kin, friend, and foe, and they are able to respond to ecological competition despite lacking the capacity of fight-or-flight. Plants are even capable of transformative behaviors that allow them to maximize their chances of survival in a dynamic and sometimes unfriendly environment.<\/p> <p>Lessons from Plants enters into the depth of botanic experience and shows how we might improve human society by better appreciating not just what plants give us but also how they achieve their own purposes. What would it mean to learn from these organisms, to become more aware of our environments and to adapt to our own worlds by calling on perception and awareness? Montgomery’s meditative study puts before us a question with the power to reframe the way we live: What would a plant do?<\/p> ",

Brooke will discuss \"Flexible reproducibility in data workflows\".<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Flexible reproducibility in data workflows<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: Sometimes, when data collected for an analysis doesn’t change, the process of tidying is a one-time investment. Other times, raw data changes by the hour or minute, requiring automated systems of extraction, transformation, and loading. But what of the case in the middle? How should analysts and data scientists handle the system changes, the month-over-month tweaks, and data sources that involve a human in the loop?<\/p> <p>This talk will cover strategies and tactics for creating resilient and flexible reproducibility in data workflows. I’ll discuss real-world examples, explore mistakes I've made along the way, and share R packages and functions that help navigate the space between customization and automation.<\/p> <p>Bio: Brooke Madubuonwu is the Director of Legal Analytics &amp; Quantitative Research at the American Civil Liberties Union, where she &amp; her team use data science &amp; statistics to advance civil rights through advocacy, legislative support, and litigation. Her work ranges from the measurement of racial and gender disparities in housing, education, and criminal justice, to the analysis of gerrymandered voting districts throughout the US. Before joining the ACLU, she trained as an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and studied zoonotic viruses as a research scientist at the NY-based nonprofit, EcoHealth Alliance.

    "description": "<p>In this workshop, you will learn how to preprocess, analyze and (quickly!) visualize oil and gas production data from .csv and .shp files. This will include merging data frames, creating new variables, filtering, and many others.<br/>You will see how R can help to manipulate datasets in different formats and explore the capabilities of dyplyr and ggplot2 - two most widely used R libraries for data analysis and visualization.<\/p> <p>Paulina Wozniakowska is working on her PhD in Geophysics with Dr. David Eaton at the University of Calgary. She received her MSc in Applied Geophysics at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, Poland. Paulina’s current research focuses on geospatial analysis of induced seismicity in Canada. She decided to learn R to have more flexibility in daily data processing and understand all the hype around ggplot.<\/p> ",

People can come and go as needed.<br/>- It does not have to be the same people each time, so you only have to commit to going once to check it out.<\/p> <p>Are you interested?

You built another AI model that will never see the light of day because it won’t make it past the AI “valley of death” – the crossover of model development to model deployment across your enterprise. The handoff between data science and engineering teams is fraught with friction, outstanding questions around governance and accountability, and who is responsible for different parts of the pipeline and process. Even worse? The patchwork approach when building an AI pipeline leaves many organizations open to risks because of a lack of a holistic approach to security and monitoring.<\/p> <p>Join us to learn about approaches and solutions for configuring a ModelOps pipeline that’s right for your organization. You’ll discover why it’s never too early to plan for operationalization of models, regardless of whether your organization has 1, 10, 100, or 1,000 models in production.<\/p> <p>The discussion will also reveal the merits of an open container specification that allows you to easily package and deploy models in production from everywhere.

Details below.<\/p> <p>Talk 1: Jai Ranchod - Extract tabular data from PDFs with pdftools<\/p> <p>I'm going to be talking about how to pull tabular data out of a PDF based on partial string matching and some functions in the \"PDF Tools\" package. The need to do this presented itself when the president of the management company wanted a table of information for the 60+ properties in our portfolio and our software vendor said they could only give us PDFs of word docs.<\/p> <p>Jai (\"Jay\") Ranchod is currently an Operations and Financial Analyst are Rose Community Management, a property management firm based in NYC with offices in Independence, OH. I started using R at my previous job at Epic Systems which is an electronic healthcare record company as part of the quality control process on their cognitive computing products. Since then I have taken several online classes in R, data science, and machine learning including a professional certificate program in data science taught using R. I have a bachelor's degree in physics from the College of Wooster and recently finished my MBA from John Carroll University.<\/p> <p>Talk 2: Bryan Lewis - R and DuckDB<\/p> <p>DuckDB (<a href=\"https://duckdb.org\" class=\"linkified\">https://duckdb.org<\/a>) is a new embedded SQL database library in the spirit of other embedded databases like SQLite. Unlike SQLite, DuckDB uses a column-oriented data layout (like R data frames) and has a particular focus on performance for interactive data analysis. DuckDB's integration with R is so complete that it can work directly on in-memory language objects without copying. This lets you use DuckDB directly on R data frames, including excellent support for dplyr.<\/p> <p>I'll show some practical examples of R and DuckDB and share my thoughts how to best use these technologies together.<\/p> <p>Bryan Lewis is a mathematician, author of the irlba and threejs R packages, and coauthor of the recent CRC textbook \"A Computational Approach to Statistical Learning.\" He previously worked on Mike Stonebraker's open-source SciDB array database project.<\/p> <p>Note: this talk will be recorded and posted on our YouTube channel.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Our August Meetup will be a remote gathering; the Zoom link will be posted the week of the event.<\/p> <p>Infographics are everywhere, and when well-designed can be a fantastic way of sharing data highlights in an engaging and visually appealing way to non-technical audiences. Typically infographics are custom made by a graphic designer who has been provided the numbers that will be represented in the graphic, and therefore can be time-intensive to produce. Producing more than one infographic of the same design to display different values (for instance, for different geographical areas) has a linear increase in production time for each n+1 graphic once the basic design time has been accounted for. This talk will describe a novel method for producing infographics using R that allows for dynamically adjusting the graphical elements based on any number of data values and rapidly producing bespoke versions. A walkthrough of the process used to create 3,142 custom infographics (one for each county in the US) will be presented to illustrate the process.<\/p> <p>Jonathan Zadra, PhD is a Director of Data Science at the non-profit Sorenson Impact Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. He combines his skills in statistics, programming, and data visualization with expertise in data privacy and policy to empower governments, nonprofits, and philanthropists working in a wide array of issue areas. His areas of focus include criminal justice data (including work with the PEW Charitable Trusts, Utah Department of Corrections, Utah Indigent Defense Commission, and Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice), early- and higher-education data including a multi-year project supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as other issue areas like homelessness or poverty, and has worked on many smaller projects building evaluations and impact measurements for a variety of social-good non-profits around the country. He received his doctorate from the University of Virginia, where he studied cognitive science and neuroscience and designed and conducted rigorous RCTs - and also fell in love with R way back in 2006!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Text is one of the most prominent and extensive data sources in the digital world. It can be an insight into consumer opinions, social media trends, and literary story arches. However, it can be difficult to analyze without specialized tools and commands. The tidytext package and framework makes it easy to go from full text files to clean data and ultimately, analysis!<\/p> <p>The workshop will start with the building blocks of text analysis: separating a text into smaller chunks, removing punctuation, and identifying frequent words or phrases. If you’ve joined our previous text analysis meetups before, this will be a great recap; if you haven’t, this will bring you right up to speed! We’ll show you all you need to know so beginners to the topic are very much welcome.<\/p> <p>The focus for the evening will be on going beyond individual words in isolation to n-grams: units of a set number of words (e.g. bigrams like “I think”, “think that”, “that tidytext”, “tidytext is”, “is great”.). This will allow us to get a sense of context about words based on the company they keep and address typical text analysis problems (e.g. \"happy\" preceded by \"not\" being given a positive sentiment score).<\/p> <p>We’ll top it all off with some truly unique visualizations that show the relationship between words, like bigram network plots with ggraph. Materials will be based on the book Tidy Text Mining by Julia Silge and David Robinson (chapter 4).<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>For the June 1st edition of our R-Ladies Dallas webinar series, we are excited to welcome Dr. Danica Slavish as our guest speaker. Dr. Slavish will introduce the topic of Latent Profile Analyses using the tidyLPA framework.<\/p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>Session title: Latent Profile Analyses using tidyLPA<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<\/p> <p>Abstract: Do adolescents who try alcohol before age 15 have worse health in adulthood than those who try alcohol later in life? Are there different subtypes of COVID-19 symptoms? How do these subtypes predict hospitalization risk? What types of advertisements most strongly predict if someone buys a product?<\/p> <p>All these questions can be answered using the statistical technique, latent profile analysis (LPA). LPA is a powerful statistical tool to identify hidden clusters in your data based on a set of variables. LPA is superior to other data reduction techniques like k-means clustering in that it generates probabilities of group membership. In this talk, a brief introduction to LPA using the R package tidyLPA will be covered. Using sample data on daily sleep patterns of nurses, we will walk through an example using the current gold standard 3-step approach: 1) estimate class membership, 2) extract class probabilities, 3) examine predictors of class membership. Best practices and advantages and disadvantages of LPA will be discussed.<\/p> <p>Bio: Dr. Danica Slavish is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of North Texas. Danica’s research focuses on how sleep problems and stressful life experiences interact to predict health outcomes across time. Her research team uses a variety of statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal data in R, including multilevel modeling, time-varying effect modeling, network analyses, and Bayesian analyses. Danica currently teaches courses in health psychology, advanced statistics, and research methods. Before joining UNT, Danica completed her Ph.D. in biobehavioral health at Penn State, where she was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. She holds an undergraduate degree in psychology from Beloit College, in Beloit, WI.<\/p> <p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danicaslavish\" class=\"linkified\">https://twitter.com/danicaslavish<\/a><\/p> <p>Website:<\/p> <p>*************************************************************************<\/p> <p>You are encouraged to click the link below to keep up with the group project and to join the Slack community.
