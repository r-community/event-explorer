If you would like to attend the event but the registration fee would put a financial strain on you, please reach out to [masked]. There are a limited number of complimentary tickets available.<\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundational knowledge to effectively use some powerful regression models used by data scientists. When data are collected on the same subjects repeatedly over time (for example, in clinical trials or cohort studies) or under different conditions (for example, in a designed experiment), the measurements within the same individual are modeled as having correlated values. At the workshop, we will consider several models that can be employed to model a normally distributed response variable. The models that we will consider are: random slope and intercept (mixed-effects) model and generalized estimating equations models with unstructured, autoregressive, compound symmetric (exchangeable), and independent working correlation matrices. All models will be run in R version 4.0.3.<\/p> <p>The course will be structured as follows. For each part, we will first discuss the theory, then work through an example. After that, the participants will work in small groups in break-out rooms to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material. All the files and Rstudio will be made available to the participants.<\/p> <p>We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be setup and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.<\/p> <p>The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book “Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications” (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/<\/a>), CRC Press, 2018.<\/p> <p># About the Instructor<br/>Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB).

    "description": "<p>**Talk**<\/p> <p>Shiny is arguably the most popular framework among data scientists for building advanced data apps. Once you build the Shiny application two questions loom: how to keep the input data up-to-date, and where to host it. The answers are often related. For example, if your data is in an on-premise database, you cannot host your app in the cloud. As data grows and changes, keeping the input to the application becomes more challenging. I have seen many enterprise users, implementing a two-step architecture. They run regular batch jobs to fetch and summarize data from their data lake or data warehouse into a staging environment. The Shiny app, then, loads staged data and presents advanced analytics to end-users.<\/p> <p>In this talk, I will show how you can use Apache Spark and the Delta Lake open source projects in your Shiny applications to directly load data from the Lake House. I will discuss how such a unified approach can remove several \"moving parts\" and simplify your work. I will present what the Lake House architecture is, and how R programs can interact with the Lake House using SparkR or sparkly. I will also demo examples of interactively developing and hosting simple Shiny apps that access large data on Databricks.<\/p> <p>**Speaker**: Hossein Falaki<\/p> <p>Currently, I am a staff software engineer at Databricks. I joined Databricks in December 2013 as one of the first software engineers. As an early employee, I had the opportunity to wear different hats including development, product management, data science, and field engineering. I have been presenting my work at leading industry conferences.<\/p> <p>As a software engineer, in addition to regular software development responsibilities, I championed and implemented several key features in Databricks product and contributed to Apache Spark. These include integration with third-party visualization libraries, end-to-end implementation of R Notebooks, integration with SparkR, integration with sparklyr, programmable input widgets, and data ingest UI. I also made several contributions to Apache Spark open-source project, including the CSV data source.<\/p> <p>As a founding member of the data science team, I built our first usage monitoring dashboards using our product and performed several deep dives and advanced analyses on topics of interest to the executive team.<\/p> <p><a href=\"http://www.falaki.net/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.falaki.net/<\/a><\/p> <p>**Schedule**<br/>6:20 Open zoom<br/>6:30-7:30 Presentation<br/>~7:30 Virtual Social<\/p> <p>**Code of Conduct**: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/codeofconduct<\/a><\/p> <p>**LA R Users Group**<br/>Invite yourself to our Slack group: <a href=\"https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://socalrug.herokuapp.com/<\/a><br/>Ask us any questions by email: [masked]<br/>Find our previous talks on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/laRusers/presentations\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/laRusers/presentations<\/a><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @la_Rusers<br/>Check out more events: <a href=\"https://socalr.org/\" class=\"linkified\">https://socalr.org/<\/a><\/p> <p>***** DON'T BE SHY *******<br/>Reach out if you want to be our speaker.

This has resulted in research describing the spreading of memes on social media, applying ideas from control theory to financial systems, and even identifying characteristics of successful competitors in Fantasy sports. You can find more information at <a href=\"https://www.joeyobrien.ie/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.joeyobrien.ie/<\/a><\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>Arising from the desire for spectators of sporting contests to obtain more enjoyment, Fantasy sports have become increasing popular in recent years. These sports involve competitors to create virtual teams that score points based upon the statistical performances of the physical athletes. Given the virtual structure of these contests there exists an array of data regarding competitor actions available online as a result of their digital traces. In this talk we will look at some techniques within the R programming language that may be used to parse this data via webscraping procedures. We will then describe one such example study focussing specifically on the Fantasy Premier League, the fantasy equivalent of the top division within English soccer. In particular we will consider visual techniques from the Tidyverse suite of packages that allow a descriptive story regarding the science of success behind those competitors who perform well in the game to be developed.<\/p> <p># Sponsors #JumpingRivers<\/p> <p>The event will be sponsored by Jumping Rivers.<\/p> <p>Jumping Rivers is an analytics company whose passion is data and machine learning.<br/><a href=\"https://www.jumpingrivers.com/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.jumpingrivers.com/<\/a><br/>twitter: twitter.com/jumping_uk<br/>linkedin: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.linkedin.com/company/jumping-rivers-ltd/<\/a><\/p> ",

We will be organizing a workshop which will cover the RNA-seq analysis.<\/p> <p>The ability to easily and efficiently analyse RNA-sequencing data is a key strength of the Bioconductor project. Starting with counts summarised at the gene-level, a typical analysis involves pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, differential expression testing and pathway analysis with the results obtained informing future experiments and validation studies. In this workflow article, we analyse RNA-sequencing data from the mouse mammary gland, demonstrating use of the popular edgeR package to import, organise, filter and normalise the data, followed by the limma package with its voom method, linear modelling and empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression and perform gene set testing. This pipeline is further enhanced by the Glimma package which enables interactive exploration of the results so that individual samples and genes can be examined by the user. The complete analysis offered by these three packages highlights the ease with which researchers can turn the raw counts from an RNA-sequencing experiment into biological insights using Bioconductor (<a href=\"https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1408\" class=\"linkified\">https://f1000research.com/articles/5-1408<\/a>).<\/p> <p>Date/Time : Februrary 6th, 2021 from 10:00 AM to 12:15 PM GMT+1<br/>Place : Zoom <a href=\"https://zoom.us/download\" class=\"linkified\">https://zoom.us/download<\/a><\/p> <p>▶️ Trainer : Xueyi Dong<br/>▶️ About Xueyi Dong (<a href=\"https://github.com/XueyiDong\" class=\"linkified\">https://github.com/XueyiDong<\/a>) :<br/>Xueyi Dong is a PhD candidate at Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.

    "description": "<p>Data Science for (gender) equality<\/p> <p>In this talk I will discuss the role of artificial intelligence in precision Despite improvements, women in STEM are still facing more challenges than their male colleagues: they earn less, more likely to leave their tech job being, and their work receives less acknowledgment. These disparities persist, despite evidence that integrated female members increase the overall intelligence of teams and gender heterogeneous teams are more creative and productive. Recent years' scandals in the tech industry brought attention to women’s marginalization in STEM. In my talk, I will showcase large-scale data-driven studies from my research to illustrate that increasing the number of women itself will not solve the problem.

The formula syntax is very similar to that of the lme4 package to provide a familiar and simple interface for performing regression analyses. A wide range of response distributions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include non-linear and smooth terms, auto-correlation structures, censored data, missing value imputation, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Multivariate models, i.e., models with multiple response variables, can be fit as well. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that reflect their beliefs. Model fits can easily be assessed and compared with posterior predictive checks, cross-validation, and Bayes factors.<\/p> <p># Speaker<\/p> <p>Paul is a statistician currently working as an Independent Junior Research Group Leader at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart (Germany).

If you would like to attend the event but the registration fee would put a financial strain on you, please reach out to [masked]. There are a limited number of complimentary tickets available.<\/p> <p># Abstract<br/>This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundational knowledge to effectively use some powerful regression models used by data scientists. When data are collected on the same subjects repeatedly over time (for example, in clinical trials or cohort studies) or under different conditions (for example, in a designed experiment), the measurements within the same individual are modeled as having correlated values. At the workshop, we will consider several models that can be employed to model a normally distributed response variable. The models that we will consider are: random slope and intercept (mixed-effects) model and generalized estimating equations models with unstructured, autoregressive, compound symmetric (exchangeable), and independent working correlation matrices. All models will be run in R version 4.0.3.<\/p> <p>The course will be structured as follows. For each part, we will first discuss the theory, then work through an example. After that, the participants will work in small groups in break-out rooms to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material. All the files and Rstudio will be made available to the participants.<\/p> <p>We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be setup and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.<\/p> <p>The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book “Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications” (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/<\/a>), CRC Press, 2018.<\/p> <p># About the Instructor<br/>Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB).

This second workshop will introduce participants to mixed models, which are otherwise known as multilevel models or sometimes also hierarchical linear models. These models are crucial for dealing with cases of non-independence, such as when multiple data points are collected from the same individual, or from the same school, district, institution, country, or any other grouping variable.

Yet some of us might feel a little overwhelmed setting it up for the first time or understanding its more complex features.<\/p> <p>In our February meeting, we will start off by showing how to set up git in RStudio and how to use it. We will then simulate a collaborative team project in which some of us make changes, others work on forked files and others just track how these changes become visible when pulling the latest version. We hope this will foster our understanding of git/github, and be a little fun, too.<\/p> <p>There is no need to prepare anything, but you might want to set up a github account prior to the meeting. As always, R users of all backgrounds, at all levels of expertise and with all degrees of imposter syndrome are welcome. This will be yet another great opportunity to learn from each other.<\/p> ",

Ggplot2, the tidyverse’s data visualisation package, based on the Grammar of Graphics upon its release in 2005 has been one of the main reasons for its super stardom primarily because of its absolute ease in allowing the user to add, remove or alter components in a plot at a high level of abstraction. The success of the package set the stage for a package to make creating tabular representations as easy. Short for “grammar of tables,\" the goal of gt is similar to that of ggplot2, serving to not just to make it effortless to make specific tables, but to describe a set of underlying components that can be recombined in different ways to solve different problems. All of this with tidyverse’s API makes the syntax simple to grasp for existing users, leading to a beautiful “camera-ready” output within minutes.<\/p> <p>This talk aims to walk the attendees through a typical gt workflow —<br/>Tidy Data —&gt; GT Object —&gt; GT Table, and then syntactically build the various components of a table I.e. the table header, the stub, the column labels and spanner column labels, the table body, and the table footer. In order to make its implementation as holistic as possible , the incorporation of ggplot2 plots inside the gt package will also be demonstrated. Although the workshop will be conducted on an inbuilt R dataset, attendees are free to use any tidy dataset during the workshop. R users of all levels are welcome!<\/p> <p>--&gt; Bio&lt;--<\/p> <p>Majoring in econometrics and completing post graduate programs in statistics, and business management, Manasi has been applying R in an academic setting across a variety of disciplines. Professionally, she has worked in advanced analytics consulting at Nielsen for a couple of years where she comprehensively used R to conduct a range of data play and visualisations in order to deliver impact oriented insights for Top FMCG clients across the South Asia region. She is currently pursuing a fellowship in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and aims to make the next move in the social sector — using data for good! She also leads the R-Ladies Mumbai chapter, and regularly blogs about her explorations with data.

Have a messy dataset and don't know where to start? Seen beautiful visualizations on Twitter and want to make your own?<\/p> <p>If you’ve answered ‘yes’ to at least one of these questions, fear no more! In this monthly workshop series, we will walk you through the fundamental uses of tidyverse and ggplot at your own pace with the help of hands-on exercises. Tidyverse and ggplot are a classic combination of R packages that allow you to \"wrangle\" your unwieldy data into whatever shape you need and creative beautiful and informative visualizations.<\/p> <p>Over the course of this series, you will learn the most useful features of R Studio and R Markdown, how to read in and explore data, and transform it into a shape that's easy to work with. You will be able to create new columns and summary tables, subset interesting rows or columns, and combine and reshape dataframes. We will also dive into ggplot, one of the best tools for creating great-looking bar charts, scatterplots, and more!<\/p> <p>This is (currently) a five-part series, aimed at total beginners and/or people with some experience in base-R or tidyverse who are looking to freshen up or expand their skills.

We're back in February with part 2 of the Generalized Linear Models workshop by Bodo Winter.<\/p> <p>In part one, Bodo Winter gave an introduction to linear models and generalized linear models. This second workshop will introduce participants to mixed models, which are otherwise known as multilevel models or sometimes also hierarchical linear models. These models are crucial for dealing with cases of non-independence, such as when multiple data points are collected from the same individual, or from the same school, district, institution, country, or any other grouping variable. After a brief conceptual introduction, the workshop gives a quick tutorial on how to use the lme4 and afex packages to fit a generalized linear mixed effects model in R.<\/p> <p>Please feel welcomed even if you didn’t make it to the first session as Bodo will begin with a very quick recap of part one anyway.<\/p> <p>In case you want to see what was covered in part one, here is a link to a recording of the first session: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/35CwxVz\" class=\"linkified\">https://bit.ly/35CwxVz<\/a><\/p> <p>A repo with access to the hands-on materials will be distributed closer to the date of the workshop.<\/p> ",

Her journey in R began two years ago, doing data analysis, modeling and applications with shiny. Cristal's background is in urban logistics researching, supply chain, and business intelligence analysis, and is an active member of volunteer communities in Costa Rica to learn and teach data science in an inclusive, accessible, and inspiring way to be able to be a promoter community in the area hand in hand with volunteering educational.<\/p> <p>Maria Kamenetsky's Abstract: Many learners are often intimidated by entering a statistics or programming course and may even ask for what topics they can review in advance. While recommending textbooks is helpful, learners limited in time may not be able to review that much material. In this talk, I will briefly present the learnr package and how it can be used as a self-assessment tool to help learners efficiently review course material.<\/p> <p>Bio: Maria is a PhD candidate in Epidemiology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her research focus is in spatial epidemiology, specifically developing statistical methods for spatial and spatio-temporal cluster detection and estimation.

    "description": "<p>Hi, everybody!<br/>We hope that you and your family are doing well. We are super excited to have Jill de Ron, PhD student at the psychological methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA) to bring you a workshop on Network analysis in R!<\/p> <p>DESCRIPTION<br/>-------------------<br/>We can use networks to provide insights into a variety of settings: A network connecting our Facebook friends gains understanding in our social structure; a human contact network gains insight into disease transmission; and a network of public transport lines informs us about the most central subway stations. In these examples, the relationships between components in the network are known. But in a lot of other cases, the relationships between components are unknown and are what we are interested in. For example, when we want to investigate the relationships between different personality traits. Network psychometrics makes it possible to estimate relationships between a large number of variables. Once you estimated a network, you can perform network-based statistics that give you information about the network’s local and global characteristics. In this workshop, you will learn how to estimate, analyze and interpret (psychological) network models. After a short introduction to network models, we will follow by a tutorial on analyzing data with network models.<\/p> <p>PROGRAMME<br/>----------------------<br/>18.30- 18.45 Virtual Welcome<br/>18.45- 20.30 Workshop and Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>ABOUT JILL<br/>-------------------<br/>I am a PhD student at the psychological methods department of the University of Amsterdam (UvA). My research is concerned with computational models of anxiety disorders and (formal) theory construction in psychology. I have a master’s degree in both Behavioral Data Science and Psychology. During my master programs I have been teaching assistant for the network analysis course at the UvA.<\/p> <p>PREREQUISITES<br/>-----------------------<br/>A basic knowledge of R is recommended. To join the tutorial, please install the bootnet package and the qgraph package.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct. Anyone who violates this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, meetup membership or other condition. We are emphatically queer and trans-friendly. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Hey R-Ladies SD members,<\/p> <p>This short course is being hosted by OCRUG on Zoom and they have kindly invited us to participate.<\/p> <p>There is a nominal cost, but they would like all to attend who want to. So there are a number of free tickets available. Just email [masked] for details.<\/p> <p>The event details provided by OCRUG are as follows:<\/p> <p>Registration is on Eventbrite (<a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ocrug-modeling-normally-distributed-data-with-repeated-measures-tickets-135236340535\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ocrug-modeling-normally-distributed-data-with-repeated-measures-tickets-135236340535<\/a>).<\/p> <p>Abstract<br/>This workshop will give you the practical skills and foundational knowledge to effectively use some powerful regression models used by data scientists. When data are collected on the same subjects repeatedly over time (for example, in clinical trials or cohort studies) or under different conditions (for example, in a designed experiment), the measurements within the same individual are modeled as having correlated values. At the workshop, we will consider several models that can be employed to model a normally distributed response variable. The models that we will consider are: random slope and intercept (mixed-effects) model and generalized estimating equations models with unstructured, autoregressive, compound symmetric (exchangeable), and independent working correlation matrices. All models will be run in R version 4.0.3.<\/p> <p>The course will be structured as follows. For each part, we will first discuss the theory, then work through an example. After that, the participants will work in small groups in break-out rooms to do hands-on exercises to help reinforce the material. All the files and Rstudio will be made available to the participants.<\/p> <p>We would like to use the RStudio Cloud. If you are not familiar with this technology, the participants use a web browser to access RStudio. The environment will be set up and loaded with the code and data that is needed. This way, participants can focus on building models.<\/p> <p>The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book [\"Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications\"](<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1138049018/<\/a>), CRC Press, 2018.<\/p> <p>About the Instructor<br/>Dr. Olga Korosteleva, is a professor of Statistics at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at California State University, Long Beach (CSULB).

Outside of his day job, Eric is passionate about connecting with the R community as the creator/host of the R-Podcast, Shiny Developer Series, and the recently-launched R Weekly Highlights podcast.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## The unintended consequences of machine learning: detecting nonsense with a markov model<\/p> <p>### Dave Evans<br/>In this talk I'll discuss how I created a transition matrix from character data to filter fraudulent signups to our web application and illustrate how using machine learning can easily introduce unwanted biases.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>## The New Roads Leading to Shiny Nirvana<\/p> <p>### Eric Nantz<\/p> <p>Since its first release over eight years ago, the R community has progressively created amazing web-based applications with the Shiny package. In practically every R conference or user meetup, we see amazing examples of how Shiny is changing the landscape of data exploration and sophisticated production pipelines. Have you ever wondered just how these amazing applications came to be, and what tools you can use to carve your own Shiny journey? In this talk I will shine a spotlight on the latest books addressing best practices in application development, and how they opened tremendous possibilities in both my professional and open-source Shiny projects.<\/p> <p>---<\/p> <p>See you there!<\/p> <p>/federico<\/p> ",

But, if you type in \"white girls,\" the results are radically different. The suggested porn sites and un-moderated discussions about \"why black women are so sassy\" or \"why black women are so angry\" presents a disturbing portrait of black womanhood in modern society.<\/p> <p>In Algorithms of Oppression, Safiya Umoja Noble challenges the idea that search engines like Google offer an equal playing field for all forms of ideas, identities, and activities. Data discrimination is a real social problem; Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, specifically women of color.<\/p> <p>Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance-operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond-understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices is of utmost importance.<\/p> <p>An original, surprising and, at times, disturbing account of bias on the internet, Algorithms of Oppression contributes to our understanding of how racism is created, maintained, and disseminated in the 21st century.<\/p> <p>PS Please contact the organizer if you need support finding the book.<\/p> ",

She previously worked at DataCamp, where she built and ran their experimentation analytics system, and at Etsy, where she worked with their search team.<\/p> <p>Dr. Jacqueline Nolis is a data science leader with over 15 years of experience in leading data science teams and projects at companies ranging from DSW to Airbnb. She has a PhD in Industrial Engineering, and for fun Jacqueline likes to use data science for humor - like using deep learning to generate offensive license plates.<\/p> <p>Authors Emily and Jaqueline will read selections from their book and discuss why parts were personally meaningful and tell stories from their pasts that ended up shaping the narrative. You’ll learn about the overarching themes from the book to help people excel in their data science careers, as well as tips that can be practical for people at all career levels. After Emily and Jacqueline discuss their book, the floor will open so anyone can ask their data science career questions.<\/p> ",

Brittany will guide us through a beginner-level tutorial on how and why to use parallel computing in R.<\/p> <p>Brittany is a Research Associate (Postdoc) at the Oregon IPM Center at Oregon State University, where she is developing a spatial modeling platform (written in R) that predicts phenology and climate suitability of invasive insect species in real-time. She is broadly interested in how environmental perturbations such as climate change shape the population dynamics and geographical range limits of plant and animal species.<\/p> <p>In her demo, she will demonstrate the use and value of the parallel, doParallel, and foreach packages for parallel computing in R. The demo will center on analyzing very large spatial data sets, but parallel processing in R can be used for ANY type of data. She will provide examples of when you may want to use parallel computing for your work, and provide further resources to explore.<\/p> <p>This demo will be held over zoom and we will RStudio Cloud so you can follow along with the Brittany's code. We will email out instructions on what to expect and how to get set up.<\/p> <p>~~How to follow Brittany’s tutorial:~~<\/p> <p>**Recommended** Option 1: Create a free RStudio Cloud account and join Brittany’s shared workspace using the link below. This will create a copy of Brittany’s R project for you and allow to run her code. The advantage of using RStudio Cloud is that all of the packages you will need are pre-installed and you’ll be working from the same settings as Brittany. This will make it much easier for us to help you if you run into any problems.<br/><a href=\"https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/119389/join?access_code=412mjNHj6%2BJmLjN24nM8Px6UDtq7qILJh%2B064Io2\" class=\"linkified\">https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/119389/join?access_code=412mjNHj6%2BJmLjN24nM8Px6UDtq7qILJh%2B064Io2<\/a><\/p> <p>Option 2: If you don’t want to use RStudio Cloud, you can clone Brittany’s repo. You will need to install the R packages ahead of time.

There are a limited number of complimentary tickets available.<\/p> <p># Abstract<\/p> <p>This workshop is meant to help data professionals transform raw data into compelling dashboards. We will use Tableau Public to learn how to create dashboard reports from a customer complaints dataset. This data will help you better understand the issues financial customers are experiencing with certain products. During this workshop, you can expect to learn how to use Tableau to ingest, transform, visualize, and use data to design a functional dashboard you can publish and share online. These dashboarding concepts can be used with varying types of datasets so you can quickly transform data into usable information. Attendees can expect to learn how to build dashboards in Tableau Public and use the free software to further develop their data visualization skills.<\/p> <p># Schedule<\/p> <p>6:30–6:45: Tableau Public Overview<br/>6:45–7:15: Exploratory Data Analysis<br/>7:15–7:45: Hands-On Exercises<br/>7:45-8:00: Break<br/>8:00–8:15: Dashboard Overview<br/>8:15–8:45: Measures and Visualizations<br/>8:45–9:15: Hands-On Exercises<br/>9:15–9:30: Tableau or Analytics QA<\/p> <p># Venue<\/p> <p>This event will be held on Zoom.

Here is my proposal:<\/p> <p>- Gather a small group of 2-5 and learn together.<br/>- Meet at a coffee shop, library, or some other space that has Wi-Fi.<br/>- Pick a project, data set or problem, then work to solve it with different tools.<br/>- Keep it fluid and informal.<br/>- Meet on a regular basis, say weekly to start, and adjust as needed.<br/>- Aim to keep the meetings 2-4 hours long, but this can be adjusted to the project or group. People can come and go as needed.<br/>- It does not have to be the same people each time, so you only have to commit to going once to check it out.<\/p> <p>Are you interested? Show up at the meeting spot, have some coffee, meet new friends and bring a project or question.<\/p> ",

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>My list of publications can also give you the big picture of my research activities:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

In questo modello ci sono 4 aree tra le quali Nancy ci guiderà: consapevolezza, creatività, coraggio e pensiero sistemico.<br/>Avere chiarezza su chi siamo e cosa ci guida accresce la nostra autostima e ci permette di relazionarci in modo autentico e coerente con chi siamo e cosa vogliamo.<\/p> <p>Dopo questo workshop:<\/p> <p>- Ti sentirai più allineata o concentrata così da saper prendere decisioni più facilmente.<br/>- Prederai consapevolezza delle leve che ti portano ad agire<br/>- Capirai come funziona il meccanismo del cambiamento e perché a volte cambiare è più difficile che non cambiare<br/>- Riconoscerai l’importanza della tua storia per andare verso il futuro più libera di fare le tue scelte<br/>- Saprai comunicare con gli altri in modo efficace<br/>- Capirai l’importanza dell’autenticità nel mondo di oggi, sia a livello personale che professionale<\/p> <p>Le persone ti scelgono per quello che sei, non per quello che fai!<\/p> <p>Ci vediamo presto!<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>This month we look at the xaringan presentation ecosystem.<\/p> <p>Thank you to EcoHealth Alliance for providing the Zoom link.<\/p> <p>Conversations during the meetup are encouraged in the monthly-meetup-chat channel in the nyhackr slack.<\/p> <p>About the Talk:<br/>The xaringan package by Yihui Xie lets R users and R Markdown authors easily blend data, text, plots and htmlwidgets into beautiful HTML presentations that look great on the web, in print, and on screens. In addition to demonstrating how to go from R Markdown to web-based slides with xaringan, in this talk I'll show you how to completely customize the appearance of your slides with xaringanthemer, a package that lets you quickly create a complete slide theme from only a few color choices. Then we'll go beyond appearances with a variety of addins and extensions from the xaringanExtra package, including: a tiled slide overview, editable slides, embedded webcam videos, tabbed panels, extra styles, shareable and embeddable slides, animations, and real time slide broadcasting.<\/p> <p>About Garrick:<br/>Garrick Aden-Buie is a Data Science Educator at RStudio and lives in sunny St. Petersburg, Florida. His passion is to combine creative coding with programming education, using code to build tools that teach coding to new and advanced R users alike. Like tidyexplain: a project that used ggplot2 and gganimate to reimagine database operations as colorful flying boxes instead of the typical Venn diagrams. Garrick has developed a number of open source addins and packages for RStudio—such as regexplain, shrtcts and rsthemes—and is always easily distracted by projects that combine R Markdown and online learning or teaching.<\/p> <p>The talk will begin at 7 PM EST and we will start admitting people to the event shortly before. Since this is completely remote there will be no pizza but everyone is encouraged to have pizza individually.<\/p> ",

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>Amal Saadallah works as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). Her main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining, also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>Her list of publications can also give you the big picture of her research activities:<br/><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

We continue our meetups with #goodRvibes and a speaker you'll definitely enjoy!<\/p> <p>Three reasons to use tidymodels with Julia Silge<\/p> <p>Modeling and machine learning in R involve a bewildering array of heterogeneous packages, and establishing good statistical practice is challenging in any language. The tidymodels (tidymodels.org) collection of packages offers a consistent, flexible framework for your modeling and machine learning work to address these problems. In this talk, we’ll focus on three specific reasons to consider using tidymodels. We will start with model characteristics themselves, move to the wise management of your data budget, and finish with feature engineering.<\/p> <p>Julia Silge is a data scientist and software engineer at RStudio PBC where she works on open source modeling tools.

She received her Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles. Her area of expertise includes design of experiments, statistical methods and applications, survey methods, and discrete choice experiments. Her recent projects include the development of a new class of experimental designs that provide higher efficiency, more in-depth analyses, and require a shorter time to run. This research has led to multiple interdisciplinary funded projects.<\/p> <p>Abstract: As science and technology progress, this often calls for innovation in methodological and theoretical development of statistical experimental design, an essential aspect for research in any discipline. This research concentrates on the close connection between statistics and medicine, and the development of novel experiments to maximize efficiency, while minimizing time and costs. The focus of this talk will be on an application of an undergraduate research project using a novel experimental design known as an Orthogonal Array Composite Design (OACD) with applications to KB oral cancer. In particular, this talk will highlight the methods and applications that undergraduate students contributed to. Furthermore, various takeaways will be presented in terms of tips, challenges, and benefits in working with undergraduate students. sources.<\/p> <p># Modernizing Design of Experiment Output with Tidyverse<br/>Speaker: Jose Toledo<br/>Graduate Student, Statistics Dept, CSU Fullerton<\/p> <p>Bio: Jose is currently in his last semester in the Master’s in statistics program at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), where he is also a teaching associate. Additionally, he is a part-time data analyst at Southern California Coast Water Project. His research interest is in the field of Design of Experiments, where he has worked on projects such as drug combination treatments for KB oral cancer and recently in tuberculosis. During his summer breaks he enjoys mentoring undergraduate students in local community colleges and providing them research opportunities early in their education.<\/p> <p>Abstract: Most Design of Experiment (DoE) experts will agree that using FrF2 is the most comprehensive R package for generating two-level factorial designs as well as Plackett-Burman type screening designs. Similarly, for sequential optimization with first order and second order response surface models, that offer optimization approaches like steepest ascent and visualization of the response function for linear model objects, the package rsm is highly recommended. However, their graphical outputs are limited and can benefit from the current “trends” in R such as implementing graphics using ggplot2. This talk will focus on the development of an R package, ggDoE, which focuses on the visualization of DoE using ggplot2. Examples will be taken from a TB drug combination experiment and demonstrate the output of commonly used methods in DoE. These methods include but are not limited to: factorial effect plots, half-normal plots, Lenth’s method, fitting second-order models and their corresponding contour plots.<\/p> <p># Meeting Materials<br/>All meeting materials will be sent to registered attendees after the event.<\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>R-Ladies Toolbox Series - Essentials for women and minority genders in academia, science and data analysis presents:<\/p> <p>Reproducibility by Charles Grey (R-Ladies Remote)<\/p> <p>Talk Abstract:<br/>As scientists, it's desirable to demonstrate to others (including our future selves) that our computational scientific work validates the claims we make in published research. Being able to reproduce the work is a key component of easily validating an analysis, as well as extending the work. Reproducibility is not as simple, however, as sharing the code and data that produced our analysis. We must consider how our data and algorithms are understood, variables defined, etc. Our code needs to be accessible and interoperable. There is much guidance about best practice, but this is often overwhelming for those of us who are not from formal computer science training. In this talk I share the story of how I attempted good enough practice in my doctoral thesis, and found even this was simply too much to achieve. Indeed, despite failing to achieve good enough scientific practice in any aspect of reproducibility, I discovered a delightful world of scientific workflows in R that make every day just that bit easier now. Failing at reproducible science in R is the best we can aim for; we will never achieve best practice in every aspect of reproducibility, and if we failed, then we tried. Through this process we discover useful tools to make the next time easier.<\/p> <p>BIO:<br/>Charles T. Gray is a postdoc with the evidence synthesis lab at Newcastle University. She is currently specialising in Bayesian network meta-analysis in Cochrane intervention reviews. She has three degrees: arts, music, and mathematics. None of these prepared her for her interdisciplinary computational metascience doctoral thesis in R.<\/p> <p>Calling all students, academics, and women in science!

    "start": "2021-03-04",
    "description": "<p>Abstract:<\/p> <p>Both complex and dynamic evolving nature of time series data make forecasting among one of the most important and challenging tasks in time series analysis. Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>My list of publications can also give you the big picture of my research activities:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>## Abstract<\/p> <p>officeverse : a set of packages to ease the production of Word and PowerPoint documents<\/p> <p>The officer package has been developed to facilitate the production of Word documents and PowerPoint presentations with R.<\/p> <p>The initial project was to offer an alternative solution to SAS ODS for tabular and graphical reports produced in Word for one of my clients. The range of functionalities has expanded and some very interesting extensions have been created. There is the officedown package that increases the layout capabilities of R Markdown when the output is Word, the rvg package to create editable vector graphics, the flextable package to make nice tables.<\/p> <p>In this presentation, you will see how to use the package to produce PowerPoint presentations and Word documents. Its role as a foundation for other packages and new documentation will be discussed. It will also be an opportunity for David to present the officedown package for the first time.<\/p> <p>## Speaker<\/p> <p>David Gohel is the founder of ArData, a French company providing R expertise, R training and consulting in data sciences. He is the author of R packages, most popular are officer, flextable, rvg and ggiraph.<\/p> <p>He is a data scientist and software engineer. His professional experiences led him to face many challenges related to the data of organizations, which he has always managed with solutions involving R software.<\/p> ",

We are super excited to have Nutsa Nanuashvili, a data enthusiast that recently graduated in Cognitive Sciences to introduce you to the tidyverse universe!<\/p> <p>DESCRIPTION<br/>-------------------<br/>The goal of this workshop is to get familiar with some useful and easy to use data transformation techniques in R. For this, we are going to go through some handy functions and commands from the famous tidyverse ecosystem. Hopefully with these tricks and tips you’re going to get more confident around transforming &amp; organizing data.<br/>During the meeting we will discuss some concepts and provide code examples, after which we’ll go through exercises to try out the newly learned concepts by ourselves. Some of the topics we’ll cover are, tidy data concept, reshaping datasets, what is and how to use the pipe %&gt;% operator, and manipulating data columns and rows.<br/>For all these we're going to use the dataset about penguins from palmerpenguins package.<\/p> <p>PROGRAMME<br/>----------------------<br/>18.30- 18.45 Virtual Welcome<br/>18.45- 20.30 Workshop and Q&amp;A<\/p> <p>ABOUT NUTSA<br/>-------------------<br/>I recently graduated with a master’s degree in Cognitive Neuroscience from the University of Amsterdam, Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies. I love programming and working on data. I especially love coding in R and I used it a lot while doing my master's projects. While looking for new adventures, I enjoy working on data and learning new concepts as part of my side-projects.<\/p> <p>PREREQUISITES<br/>-----------------------<br/>A basic knowledge of R is recommended. Please install the tidyverse package.<\/p> <p>CODE OF CONDUCT<br/>----------------------------<br/>We expect all attendees to abide by our Code of Conduct. Anyone who violates this community's Code of Conduct will be refused entry, expelled, and/or any other action deemed appropriate by the Organizer, regardless of event registration, meetup membership or other condition. We are emphatically queer and trans-friendly. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn.<\/p> ",

You may have come across this when trying to interpret a residual plot from a logistic regression. For discrete data, these are not really artefacts, they are properties of the distribution of the data, like mean-variance relationships and lots of zeros. Generalised linear models and their extensions model the distribution of the data, including these properties, and so are a good way to remove them, to better see the patterns we are actually interested in. I will talk though some concepts and lots of examples of how we can use models to get the best out of our visualisations of discrete multivariate data in R.<\/p> <p>Biography: Gordana is a statistical consultant and research fellow at UNSW Sydney, with research interests in modelling and visualising multivariate discrete data in ecology. In her spare time, Gordana can be found hiking or ocean swimming (poorly but enthusiastically).<\/p> <p>Website link: <a href=\"https://statsoc.org.au/event-4144562?CalendarViewType=1&amp;SelectedDate=2/15/2021\" class=\"linkified\">https://statsoc.org.au/event-4144562?CalendarViewType=1&amp;SelectedDate=2/15/2021<\/a><\/p> ",

It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.<\/p> <p>Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”<\/p> <p>Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed..<\/p> <p>PS This book is available free online: <a href=\"https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/\" class=\"linkified\">https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/<\/a><\/p> ",

Typical methods for forecasting are designed to model time-evolving dependencies between data observations. However, it is generally accepted that none of them is universally valid for every application. Therefore, methods for learning heterogeneous ensembles by combining a diverse set of forecasts together appear as a promising solution to tackle this task. Ensemble construction is based on several steps including base models generation, pruning and aggregation. The goal of this talk is to present the most promising R packages/solutions for automating adaptive ensemble models construction for online time series forecasting by reducing the human intervention in the ML-loop<\/p> <p>Short Bio:<\/p> <p>I am Amal Saadallah and I work as a research assistant in the artificial intelligence group of the TU Dortmund, within B3 subproject (Data Mining on Sensor Data of Automated Processes) of the Collaborative Research Center SFB 876 (Providing Information by Resource-Constrained Data Analysis). My main research work is about adaptive ensemble methods for online learning, time series analysis and forecasting and sensor-simulation data mining. I am also investigating industry 4.0 related applications, more specifically for machining processes. Hence, one of the major research directions in B3 is the combination of machine learning methods and process simulation systems for predictive maintenance and quality control of milling processes.<\/p> <p>My list of publications can also give you the big picture of my research activities:<\/p> <p><a href=\"https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www-ai.cs.tu-dortmund.de/PERSONAL/saadallah.html<\/a><\/p> ",

    "description": "<p>Les réseaux bayésiens pour la modélisation des toxicités aiguës dans le cadre du traitement par radiothérapie du cancer du sein.<\/p> <p>Ces dernières décennies, l'augmentation considérable du volume de données médicales a fait naître, chez les structures hospitalières, le besoin de s'inscrire dans une démarche Big Data, afin de stocker leurs données mais également d'intégrer leur exploitation au sein des différents projets de recherches qu'elles supportent. À ce titre, la Data Science a fait son entrée dans le monde médical par l'intermédiaire d'algorithmes de Machine Learning et de Deep Learning ainsi que des méthodes d'analyse statistique. Un réseau bayésien est un modèle probabiliste utilisé pour représenter les relations de dépendance conditionnelle (et dans certains cas de causalité) entre différentes variables. Souvent oubliée par la communauté scientifique lors de l'analyse de données, cette méthode présente pourtant de nombreux avantages qui peuvent se révéler être des atouts de taille pour l'analyse de données médicales<\/p> ",

An after-thought or as place-holders for numbers. For me, tables are the sexiest visualizations in the Viz world; a good table conveys more to me through its simplicity than the sometimes confusing array of colors, shapes and sizes of a plot.<\/p> <p>Bio: I am a data engineer at Converging Health who is a also a bench-trained PhD scientist.

La chiave sta nell'essere focalizzati e forti emotivamente. In questo modello ci sono 4 aree tra le quali Nancy ci guiderà: consapevolezza, creatività, coraggio e pensiero sistemico.<br/>Avere chiarezza su chi siamo e cosa ci guida accresce la nostra autostima e ci permette di relazionarci in modo autentico e coerente con chi siamo e cosa vogliamo.<\/p> <p>Dopo questo workshop:<br/>- Ti sentirai più allineata o concentrata così da saper prendere decisioni più facilmente.<br/>- Prederai consapevolezza delle leve che ti portano ad agire<br/>- Capirai come funziona il meccanismo del cambiamento e perché a volte cambiare è più difficile che non cambiare<br/>- Riconoscerai l’importanza della tua storia per andare verso il futuro più libera di fare le tue scelte<br/>- Saprai comunicare con gli altri in modo efficace<br/>- Capirai l’importanza dell’autenticità nel mondo di oggi, sia a livello personale che professionale<\/p> <p>Le persone ti scelgono per quello che sei, non per quello che fai!<\/p> <p>Ci vediamo presto!<\/p> ",

At the ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk) we are analysing key data-driven responses to Covid-19 and collating lessons learned by way of stakeholder interviews, case study analysis, and representative public surveys. In this talk, I will highlight some key findings from our stakeholder interviews and reflect on the role of data science during the Covid-19 pandemic. I will discuss successful applications of data science, ethical issues to be aware of, and what stakeholders *really* think about working with data scientists.<\/p> <p>Bio: Matthew Higgs MMath, PhD is a Lecturer in the Department of Computing and Information Sciences at Northumbria University and a Co-Investigator on the UKRI-funded project ‘Observatory for Monitoring Data-Driven Approaches to Covid-19’ (omddac.org.uk). Since completing his PhD in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London in 2011, Matthew has worked in technical and non-technical roles in academia, the commercial sector, and the public sector - with a focus on managing diverse stakeholders and developing data-driven products and solutions.<\/p> ",
